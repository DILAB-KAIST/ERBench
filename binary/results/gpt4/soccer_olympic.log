Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, A. Diamanti played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where the soccer club A. Diamanti played for in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics. In 2019, Alessandro Diamanti played for Western United FC, which is based in Melbourne, Australia.

The Summer Olympics are held every four years, and the 2019 year did not coincide with this schedule. The most recent Summer Olympics as of 2019 were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2016.
