Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude -31.9167003632 and longitude 133.0?
A:Unsure. Without access to real-time, comprehensive global geographic and aviation data, it's not possible to definitively confirm whether there are no airports located at the specific coordinates of latitude -31.9167003632 and longitude 133.0. This would require a detailed search of global airport databases and mapping systems. However, these coordinates point to a location in South Australia, which is largely desert and sparsely populated, so it's possible that there may not be an airport at these exact coordinates.
