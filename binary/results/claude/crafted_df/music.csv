1) The British rock band Badfinger had a hit song called ""Day After Day"" that was released in 1971 on their album ""Straight Up."" This seems like it could be the song you're referring to.
2) There was also a song called ""Day by Day"" released in 1971 by the British band Family Dogg, though the title is slightly different than ""Day After Day.""

- The French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré released an album called ""L'Espoir"" in 1975 which contained a track titled ""Élégie."" This seems like a plausible match, though the spelling differs slightly from ""Elegie.""
- The German progressive rock band Eloy released an album called ""Dawn"" in 1976 which had an instrumental track titled ""Elegie."" This is close in timeframe but may not be an exact 1975 release.

The song became a staple of the Rolling Stones' live shows and is considered one of their classic hits from their 1960s period.

237, Is it true that no artists nor groups sang a song titled surfin' bird in 1989?,118,1,no,"it is not true that no artists or groups sang a song titled ""surfin' bird"" in 1989.The song ""Surfin' Bird"" was originally recorded by the American novelty act The Trashmen in 1963. However, in 1989, the song experienced a resurgence in popularity after being featured in the movie Back to School starring Rodney Dangerfield.
As a result of its inclusion in the movie, ""Surfin' Bird"" was re-released as a single in 1989 and charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at #63. The version that charted in 1989 was a re-recording by The Trashmen themselves, capitalizing on the song's newfound popularity from the movie.
So, while ""Surfin' Bird"" was not a brand new song in 1989, it did receive significant attention and chart success that year due to its appearance in Back to School, with The Trashmen re-recording and re-releasing their original 1963 hit.

However, it's possible such a song existed but is not well cataloged or documented online. The music industry was very different in the pre-internet era, and not all releases were comprehensively tracked, especially more niche or regional artists.

It became one of Williams' most famous and popular songs. While it has been covered by many other artists over the years, the original version by Hank Williams predates 1978 by over two decades.

So in summary, while the ""gangsta"" theme is prevalent in rap music, I'm unsure if there was a specific song widely released in 2018 with that exact title by a known artist. More context about the artist or where you heard the song could help narrow it down. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details!

The song ""If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)"" was included on their album ""My Home's in Alabama"" released in 1980.
The song celebrates the importance of the fiddle in country and western music, especially in the state of Texas which has a rich tradition of fiddle music. The lyrics poke fun at the idea of a country band trying to play in Texas without having a fiddle player.
The song became a big hit for Alabama, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1981. It helped solidify their reputation as one of the top country acts of the 1980s blending traditional and contemporary country sounds.

702, Is there an artist or group who sang a song titled eight miles high in 1965?,353,0,yes,"the song ""eight miles high"" was recorded and released by the american rock band the byrds in 1965.""Eight Miles High"" was written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn (later known as Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby, and it appeared on The Byrds' third album, ""Fifth Dimension,"" released in July 1965. The song is widely considered one of the first examples of psychedelic rock and is known for its innovative guitar work and lyrics that were interpreted as referring to drug use, although the band members denied this.
The song's title and lyrics, which include lines like ""Rain grey town, known for its sound/In places, small faces/Unbound,"" were seen as references to aerospace travel and hallucinogenic experiences. The song's distinctive ringing guitar tone, created by combining a 12-string Rickenbacker and a fuzzbox, also contributed to its psychedelic sound.
""Eight Miles High"" was a significant departure from The Byrds' earlier folk rock sound and helped establish them as pioneers of the emerging psychedelic rock genre. While it was not a major commercial success at the time, reaching only No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, it has since become one of The Byrds' most influential and celebrated songs.

The song was written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn, and David Crosby, and it is considered one of the first psychedelic rock songs and a landmark in the development of the genre.
The song's lyrics and title were inspired by the experience of flying on airplanes and the idea of being ""eight miles high"" in the air. However, the song's lyrics were also interpreted as being about drug use, particularly the use of psychedelic drugs like LSD, which was controversial at the time.
So, in summary, The Byrds did indeed release and perform the song ""Eight Miles High"" in 1965, and it became a significant and influential work in the emerging psychedelic rock movement.

However, I could not find any credible evidence of a popular song from 1956 with that exact title.
Some possibilities I considered:
- ""Too Close for Comfort"" was a popular song from 1956, recorded by several artists like Jerry Vale and The McGuire Sisters. But the title is different.
- ""Too Much"" was a hit song in 1956 by Elvis Presley and others. Again, the title doesn't match.
- There are some more obscure songs with ""marvelous"" in the title from around that era, but none exactly matching ""Too Marvelous for Words"" that I could definitively confirm as a 1956 release by a known artist/group.
So unless I'm missing an more obscure recording, it does not appear there was a mainstream song released in 1956 specifically titled ""Too Marvelous for Words."" Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details that could help identify a potential matching song.

Disturbed is a well-known and successful rock band, formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1994. They have released seven studio albums to date and are known for their heavy, nu-metal/alternative metal sound and socially conscious lyrics.

The lyrics were written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx, and set to music.
Billie Holiday's 1939 recording of ""Strange Fruit"" for Commodore Records is considered one of the most influential and important songs of the 20th century. It was controversial at the time due to its blunt condemnation of racism and lynching, but it became an important part of the civil rights movement and a landmark musical work addressing social injustice.
So while ""Strange Fruit"" is a seminal and historically significant song, it predates 1956 by over 15 years and was not released or recorded by any artist or group in that particular year.

1193, Is it true that no artists nor groups sang a song titled strange fruit in 1956?,598,1,no,"it is not true that no artists or groups sang a song titled ""strange fruit"" in 1956.The song ""Strange Fruit"" was originally written as a poem by Abel Meeropol in the 1930s, protesting the lynching of African Americans in the United States. It was first recorded as a song by Billie Holiday in 1939 and became one of her most famous and impactful recordings.
While Billie Holiday's 1939 version is the most well-known and influential recording of ""Strange Fruit,"" the song continued to be performed and recorded by other artists in subsequent years, including in 1956.
In 1956, the jazz singer Nina Simone recorded a version of ""Strange Fruit"" on her debut album ""Little Girl Blue."" Simone's powerful rendition of the song helped to keep its message and protest against racism and violence alive in the mid-20th century.
So, while Billie Holiday's original recording predated 1956, it is not accurate to say that no artists or groups sang ""Strange Fruit"" in that particular year, as Nina Simone's version was released and performed in 1956.

There have been some cover versions of ""Maniac"" over the years by various artists, but I couldn't find any new original song by that title released in 2010 after searching online databases of music releases.

It's possible that a lesser-known artist or group released a song called ""Maniac"" in 2010 that didn't gain widespread popularity or chart success, making it harder to find definitive information about its existence. Alternatively, it's also possible that no such song was indeed released that year by any artist.

Without being able to comprehensively search all music releases from 2001, I cannot say with full certainty whether such a song existed or not that year.
Major hits and releases from well-known artists are easier to find records of, but more niche or underground music can sometimes slip through the cracks in terms of complete documentation and archiving.

However, without extensively researching music releases from 2004, I can't definitively say whether that exact title was used by any artists or groups that particular year.
Many songs simply titled ""Deja Vu"" exist from various years, but the parenthetical ""All Over Again"" makes this a more specific query that I don't have enough information to confirm or deny with full confidence for the year 2004 specifically.

1) Billy Vera and the Beaters had a hit song called ""At This Moment"" in 1987 that contained the lyrics ""Let me down easy."" But it wasn't the actual title and was from a few years later.
2) The band Gang of Four released an album called ""Hard"" in 1983 that had a song titled ""Is It Love?"" with lyrics that included the phrase ""let me down easy."" But again, not the exact title.
3) There was a country song called ""Let Me Down Easy"" released in 1984, but it was by singer Ronnie McDowell, not a major pop/rock artist or group.

More context about the genre, artist, or where you encountered a potential reference to this song would help narrow it down.

Some other notable songs with ""moon"" in the title from around that time period include:

The lyrics of ""Fight for Your Right"" are humorous and satirical, with the Beastie Boys portraying rowdy party-goers who rebel against authority figures and societal norms.

Unless there was a very obscure release I'm missing, it does not seem that a new recording of ""Tiger Rag"" came out specifically in 1995. The song remains a popular jazz standard played by many artists, but the year 1995 does not appear to have a notable new version released.

The song originated in the early 20th century and has been a popular tune in the traditional jazz and Dixieland repertoire. Some of the most well-known recordings were by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1917 and Les Brown and His Band of Renown's big band version in 1942.

While this carol has been recorded and performed by many artists over the decades, I don't have definitive information on whether any specific recording of it was released in 1967 or not. It's an older, traditional carol, so new recordings in any given year are possible but not guaranteed. Without being able to search comprehensive music release databases from 1967, I can't say for certain if your statement is true or false.

1700, Is there an artist or group who sang a song titled first things first in 1980?,854,0,no,"i'm not aware of any song titled ""first things first"" released in 1980 by a major artist or group.After searching online databases and music references, I couldn't find any credible information about a song by that exact title being released or charting in 1980. It's possible there was an obscure or lesser-known artist who released a song with that title that year, but none that achieved significant popularity or commercial success.
Some potential reasons why I couldn't find a definitive match:
1) The song title is slightly different than ""First Things First"" and my search missed it.
2) It was released by a very obscure or regional artist that didn't get widespread attention.
3) The song was from 1980 but my sources were incomplete or missed listing it.
4) There simply wasn't a notable song by that exact title released in that specific year.
Without more context about the artist, genre, or other details, I can't provide a more definitive answer. But based on my research, I did not find evidence of a mainstream or popular song called ""First Things First"" from 1980. Let me know if you have any other details that could help narrow the search.

1776, Is there an artist or group who sang a song titled one of these days in 1960?,892,0,yes,"there is an artist who sang a song titled ""one of these days"" in 1960.The song ""One of These Days"" was recorded and released by American singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked in 1988. However, it was not originally written or recorded in 1960.
The song is a cover of a folk song that has been recorded by various artists over the years, with the earliest known commercial recording being by Earl Robinson in 1949. Other notable versions include those by Peter, Paul and Mary in 1963 and Joan Baez in 1964.

Their song ""Indians"" was released as a single in 1987 and became a hit in several European countries, including Sweden, Norway, and Germany.
The song has a catchy synth-pop sound that was characteristic of the late 1980s pop music scene. The lyrics of ""Indians"" are about a romanticized view of Native American culture and lifestyle, which was a somewhat common theme in pop culture at the time, although it could be considered culturally insensitive by today's standards.
""Indians"" was included on Antique's album ""Inca,"" which was released in 1987 and was a commercial success, particularly in Scandinavia and parts of Europe.

""A Figure Walks"" was written by Genesis members Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. It's an instrumental track, without any vocals, and features prominent piano and guitar parts. The song showcases the band's progressive rock sound and musicianship.
So while it may be an obscure or lesser-known Genesis song, especially since it's an instrumental, the statement that no artists or groups sang a song titled ""A Figure Walks"" in 1979 is incorrect.

So while the original song predates 1956, Vaughn Monroe did record and release a version with the modified title ""(When Your Heart's On Fire) Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" in that specific year.

""The Wanderer"" was Dion's biggest solo hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961. The song's lyrics tell the story of a restless young man who wanders from town to town and has romantic encounters with different women along the way. With its distinctive doo-wop sound and Dion's powerful vocals, ""The Wanderer"" became one of the most iconic songs of the early rock and roll era.

""The Wanderer"" was written by Ernie Maresca and became one of Dion's signature songs. It tells the story of a modern-day wandering traveler and features Dion's distinctive vocals backed by a rock and roll sound with doo-wop influences. The song helped establish Dion as a successful solo artist after his time with the vocal group Dion and the Belmonts.
So while the song didn't come out in 1960 exactly, it was very much a hit song performed by Dion in the early 1960s era. Its 1961 release and chart success means the statement that no artists sang ""The Wanderer"" in 1960 is incorrect.

It was the lead single from their album ""Music for the Masses,"" released in September 1987.
""Strangelove"" became one of Depeche Mode's biggest hits, reaching the top 20 in several countries, including the United States, where it peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
The song's lyrics, written by Martin Gore, are about a person's obsession with a lover, using the metaphor of a ""strange love"" or ""strangelove."" The music video for ""Strangelove"" was also notable for its stylized and provocative imagery.
So, in summary, the statement that no artists or groups sang a song titled ""Strangelove"" in 1987 is false, as Depeche Mode's hit single of that name was a major release that year.
