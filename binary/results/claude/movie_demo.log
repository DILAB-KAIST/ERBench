Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 1999, starring Tony Curran where John McTiernan is the director?
A:I'm not aware of any movies released in 1999 that were directed by John McTiernan and starred Tony Curran.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2008, starring Alain Delon where Frédéric Forestier is the director?
A:I'm unsure if there are any movies released in 2008 starring Alain Delon and directed by Frédéric Forestier. Alain Delon is a famous French actor who was very active in the 1960s-1980s, so it seems unlikely he would have starred in a film in 2008 at around 73 years old. And Frédéric Forestier does not appear to be a very prolific or well-known director, making it hard to definitively say if they collaborated on a 2008 film or not. Without being able to find clear evidence of such a movie existing, the safest answer is that there are likely no 2008 movies meeting those criteria.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 1982, starring William Smith where John Milius is the director?
A:No, I could not find any movie released in 1982 where William Smith starred and John Milius was the director.

William Smith was an actor known for movies like Rich Man, Poor Man (1976 TV series), Any Which Way You Can (1980), and several other action/exploitation films in the 70s and 80s, but I didn't find any collaboration between him and director John Milius in 1982 specifically.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2015, starring Tim Conway where Paul Tibbitt is the director?
A:No, there does not appear to be a movie released in 2015 starring Tim Conway and directed by Paul Tibbitt.

Tim Conway was a famous comedic actor who had a long career in television, movies and on stage, but he was already quite elderly by 2015. His last major live-action movie role was in 1980.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2015, starring Tim Conway where Paul Tibbitt is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2015 starring Tim Conway where Paul Tibbitt is the director.

Tim Conway was a legendary comedian and actor, but he passed away in 2019 at the age of 85. Paul Tibbitt is best known as the director and producer of the animated TV series SpongeBob SquarePants, but he has not directed any live-action movies starring Tim Conway.

In 2015, Tim Conway was 81 years old, so it's unlikely he would have starred in a major live-action film at that stage of his career. And Paul Tibbitt has primarily worked in animation, not live-action films. So the combination of those two specifics - a 2015 movie with Tim Conway starring and Paul Tibbitt directing - does not seem to exist.

A:I'm unsure if there is a movie from 1988 starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by Peter MacDonald. I don't have enough information to definitively confirm or deny this.

Peter MacDonald is not a very well-known director name, so it's possible he directed a smaller/lesser-known film with Stallone in 1988, but I can't find any credible sources listing a movie matching that description. Sylvester Stallone was a major star in 1988, so if such a collaboration existed, it seems like it would be more widely documented.

Without being able to find concrete evidence one way or the other, the safest answer is that I'm unsure if such a movie exists or not. More research would be needed to say definitively.
