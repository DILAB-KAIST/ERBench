A:No, it is not true that the city where Gareth Bale played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Milan hosted the 1906 Summer Olympics, which were the fourth edition of the modern Olympic Games. These Olympics were originally awarded to the city of Rome, but they were later relocated to Milan due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906.

So, while Milan has not hosted the Summer Olympics in recent times, it did host the 1906 Summer Olympics, making the statement "the city where Lukaku played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics" incorrect.

A:No, the city where Sergej Milinković-Savić played for Lazio in 2019, which is Rome, has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, S. Milinković-Savić played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Sergej Milinković-Savić played for in 2019 (which is Rome for Lazio) never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Rome hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960. The 1960 Summer Olympics were held in Rome, Italy from August 25 to September 11, 1960. This was the first time the Olympic Games were held in the capital city of Italy.

- The Olympic flame was lit by Giancarlo Giaretti using the rays of the sun.
- A total of 83 nations participated, which was a record at that time.
- The Olympic Stadium (Stadio Olimpico) in Rome was the main venue for the games.

Barcelona hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics. The 1992 Olympic Games were held in Barcelona, Spain, from July 25 to August 9, 1992. This was the first time that the Olympic Games were staged in Spain.

Some key facts about the 1992 Barcelona Olympics:

- It was one of the most successful Olympic Games in history, introducing several new elements like the Olympic Truce and the Paralympic Games being held in the same city after the Olympics.

- The main venues were the Montjuïc area, the Olympic Ring in Vall d'Hebron, and the Olympic Village in the Poblenou neighborhood.

- The Barcelona Olympics are considered a great success and helped revitalize the city, showcasing its culture and architecture to the world.

A:No, it is not true that the city where Jerome Boateng played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

In 2019, Jerome Boateng played for Bayern Munich, which is based in Munich, Germany. Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics.

The 1972 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Munich, West Germany, from August 26 to September 11, 1972. These Olympic Games are remembered for the Munich massacre, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were taken hostage and eventually killed by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September.

E. Višća is a soccer club based in Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Visoko is a small city in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

The Summer Olympics are major international multi-sport events that are typically hosted by large cities or metropolitan areas with the necessary infrastructure and facilities to accommodate the large number of athletes, officials, and spectators. Visoko, being a relatively small city, does not have the resources or infrastructure required to host such a massive event.

Unless I'm missing some crucial information, it is safe to say that Visoko, the home city of E. Višća in 2019, has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

Monaco has hosted the Olympic Games before. Specifically, it hosted some events of the 1924 Summer Olympics, which were primarily held in Paris, France. The Olympic equestrian events (dressage, eventing, and jumping) took place in Monaco.

A:No, the city where Arkadiusz Milik played for Napoli in 2019 (Naples, Italy) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Naples is a major city in southern Italy, but the Summer Olympics have never been held there. Italy has hosted the Summer Olympics twice, but in different cities:

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, A. Milik played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:To answer this question, I would need more information about which soccer club Arkadiusz Milik played for in 2019.

Milik is a Polish professional soccer player. In 2019, he played for the Italian club Napoli, which is based in Naples, Italy.

Naples has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

So if the question is referring to Napoli being the club Milik played for in 2019, then the answer is yes, it is true that the city where that club is located (Naples) has never hosted the Summer Olympics.

However, if Milik played for a different club in 2019, I would need to know which city that club is located in to determine if that city has hosted the Olympics or not.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, Gonçalo Guedes played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Gonçalo Guedes played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

In 2019, Gonçalo Guedes played for Valencia CF, a professional soccer club based in Valencia, Spain.

The city of Valencia hosted some events of the 1992 Summer Olympics, which were primarily held in Barcelona. Specifically, Valencia hosted the preliminary rounds of the Olympic soccer tournament in 1992.

So, while Valencia was not the main host city for the 1992 Summer Olympics, it did serve as one of the host cities for certain Olympic events, including soccer matches.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, N. Pépé played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Nicolas Pépé played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Nicolas Pépé played for Lille OSC, a professional soccer club based in Lille, France, in the 2018-19 season before transferring to Arsenal in 2019.

The city of Lille hosted several events of the 1924 Summer Olympics, which were officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad and were held in Paris, France. Specifically, Lille hosted the football (soccer) tournament and some cycling events during those 1924 Olympics.

So, while Lille itself was not the main host city for the entire Olympic Games, it did serve as a venue city for certain events of the 1924 Summer Olympics held in France.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, G. Lo Celso played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where Giovani Lo Celso played for Real Betis in 2019 (Seville, Spain) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Seville is a major city in southern Spain, but it has never been the host city for the Summer Olympic Games. The Summer Olympics have been held in Spain twice, but in different cities:

1992 - Barcelona
1992 was the last time Spain hosted the Summer Olympics, which took place in Barcelona.

1992 was also the year that the Olympic soccer tournaments began including players from the top professional leagues, rather than just amateur players.

So while Seville is a city with a rich history and culture, and an important soccer club in Real Betis, it has not had the honor of hosting an Olympic Games itself.

Lo Celso played for Real Betis in Seville, Spain, during the 2018-19 season. Seville hosted the 1999 World Athletics Championships, but it has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

However, Barcelona, another major city in Spain, hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics. So the statement that the city where Lo Celso played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect.

A:No, the city where Rúben Neves played for his soccer club in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics.

Rúben Neves is a Portuguese professional footballer who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. in 2019. Wolverhampton is a city in the West Midlands region of England. The Summer Olympics have never been held in Wolverhampton or any other city in the West Midlands region.

The most recent Summer Olympics held in the United Kingdom were the 2012 London Olympics. Previous Summer Olympics in the UK were held in London in 1908 and 1948.
Gold Answer: no
Gold Entity: Wolverhampton Wanderers, wolverhampton,  

316-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, Rúben Neves played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Rúben Neves played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Rúben Neves played for Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. in 2019, which is based in Wolverhampton, England. The city of Wolverhampton has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

However, London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, has hosted the Summer Olympics three times - in 1908, 1948, and 2012.

So while Wolverhampton itself has not hosted the Olympics, the country where Neves played (England/United Kingdom) has indeed hosted the Summer Olympics multiple times in its capital city of London.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, P. Kimpembe played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:Yes, the city where Presnel Kimpembe played for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2019, which is Paris, has hosted the Summer Olympics.

Paris hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924. The 1900 Summer Olympics were the second modern Olympic Games, while the 1924 Summer Olympics were the eighth edition of the modern Olympic Games.

In 1900, the Olympic Games were held as part of the World's Fair in Paris, and the events were spread over five months and two locations (Paris and its suburbs). In 1924, the Games were more organized and centralized in Paris, with the main venues being the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir and the Velodrome Buffalo.

So, Paris, the city where Presnel Kimpembe played for PSG in 2019, has hosted the Summer Olympics twice in its history, making it one of the few cities to have hosted the Games multiple times.
Gold Answer: yes
Gold Entity: Paris Saint-Germain, paris, 1924,1900,

A:No, it is not true that the city where Presnel Kimpembe played for his soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Presnel Kimpembe plays for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), which is based in Paris, France. The city of Paris has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice - in 1900 and 1924.

So the statement that the city where Kimpembe played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect, as Paris has indeed hosted the Olympics on two occasions in the past.

Gold Answer: no

In 2019, Steven Bergwijn played for PSV Eindhoven, a Dutch soccer club based in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

The city of Amsterdam, which is also located in the Netherlands, hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics.

So the city where Bergwijn played (Eindhoven) did not host the Olympics, but another major Dutch city (Amsterdam) did host the Summer Olympics in the past.

1928 - Amsterdam hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics
1928 - Amsterdam hosted the 1928 Summer Olympics
1992 - Barcelona, Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics

So while Amsterdam is a major city, it has not specifically been a host city for the Summer Olympic Games, despite the Netherlands hosting the event twice in its history.

In 2019, Nélson Semedo played for Barcelona, which is a soccer club based in Barcelona, Spain. Barcelona has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

The Summer Olympics have been held in Spain twice, but in different cities:

1. The 1992 Summer Olympics were held in Barcelona.
2. The 1992 Summer Paralympics were also held in Barcelona after the Olympics.

However, Nélson Semedo was not playing for Barcelona in 1992 as he was born in 1993. In 2019, when the question refers to, he was playing for the Barcelona club, but the city of Barcelona itself had not hosted the Olympics that year.

A:No, it is not true that the city where Geoffrey Kondogbia played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

In 2019, Kondogbia played for Valencia CF, a professional soccer club based in Valencia, Spain. The city of Valencia hosted some events of the 1992 Summer Olympics, which were primarily held in Barcelona.

Specifically, the preliminary rounds of football (soccer) competitions took place in Valencia during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The Estadio Luis Casanova and Estadio de la Cartuja in Valencia were used as venues for the Olympic football matches.

So while Valencia was not the main host city for those Olympics, it did serve as one of the co-host cities by hosting certain events, including the early stages of the Olympic soccer tournament. Therefore, the statement that the city where Kondogbia played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, Lucas Vázquez played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where Lucas Vázquez played for his soccer club in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics.

Lucas Vázquez is a Spanish professional footballer who has played for Real Madrid since 2015. Real Madrid is based in Madrid, the capital city of Spain.

Madrid has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The only time Spain has hosted the Summer Olympics was in 1992 when Barcelona was the host city.
Gold Answer: no
Gold Entity: Real Madrid CF, madrid,  

383-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, Lucas Vázquez played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Lucas Vázquez played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Lucas Vázquez played for Real Madrid in 2019, and Real Madrid is based in Madrid, Spain. The city of Madrid hosted the Summer Olympics in 1992.

So the statement "the city, where the soccer club Lucas Vázquez played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics" is incorrect because Madrid did host the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Without knowing which specific club and city you are referring to, I cannot definitively answer whether that city has hosted the Summer Olympics before.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, P. Zieliński played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where Piotr Zieliński played for Napoli in 2019 (Naples, Italy) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Naples is a major city in southern Italy, but the Summer Olympics have never been held there. Italy has hosted the Summer Olympics twice, but in different cities:

1) The 1960 Summer Olympics were held in Rome.
2) The 2006 Winter Olympics were held in Turin.

So while Naples is a large and historic Italian city, it has not had the opportunity to host the Olympic Games yet.
Gold Answer: no
Gold Entity: Napoli, naples,  

385-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, P. Zieliński played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:To answer this question, I would need more information about which soccer club Piotr Zieliński played for in 2019.

Zieliński is a Polish professional soccer player who currently plays as a midfielder for Napoli in the Italian Serie A league. In 2019, he was playing for Napoli.

Naples, the city where Napoli is based, has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

So if the question is referring to Napoli being the club Zieliński played for in 2019, then the answer is yes, the city where that club is located (Naples) has never hosted the Summer Olympics.

However, if the question is referring to a different club Zieliński may have played for in 2019, I cannot definitively answer without knowing which city that club is based in. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional context about the club mentioned.

A:No, the city where the Egyptian soccer club Ismaily is based, which is Ismailia, has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

A:Yes, it is true that the city where the soccer club Ismaily played in 2019 has never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Ismaily is an Egyptian soccer club based in the city of Ismailia, which is located in northeastern Egypt, along the Suez Canal. Egypt has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games, so Ismailia has also never been an Olympic host city.

The Summer Olympics have been held in various cities around the world, but never in Egypt or any other city in the Arab world. The closest the Olympics have come to the region was in 2004 when Athens, Greece hosted the Games.

Unless I'm missing some key information, based on the fact that Ismaily is an Egyptian club from the city of Ismailia, and Egypt has never hosted the Summer Olympics, it is safe to say that Ismailia itself has also never been an Olympic host city.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, B. Mendy played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Benjamin Mendy played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

In 2019, Benjamin Mendy played for Manchester City, which is based in Manchester, England. The city of Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but it has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

However, London, the capital of the United Kingdom, has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012.

So while Manchester itself has not hosted the Olympics, the country where Mendy's club is located (England/United Kingdom) has indeed hosted the Summer Olympics multiple times in its capital city of London.

The 1906 Games were originally awarded to Milan but were later moved to Athens, Greece due to an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy. However, some sources still consider Milan as a host city for those Games.

The 1960 Summer Olympics were officially hosted by Rome, but several events like soccer took place in other Italian cities including Milan.

A:No, it is not true that the city where Thilo Kehrer played for his soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Thilo Kehrer played for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2019, which is based in Paris, France. The city of Paris has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in 1900 and 1924.

So the statement that the city where Kehrer played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect because Paris has indeed hosted the Olympics on two occasions in the past.

The 1972 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Munich, West Germany, from August 26 to September 11, 1972. These Olympic Games are remembered for the Munich massacre, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were taken hostage and eventually killed by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September.

A:No, the city where Rodrigo Bentancur played for Juventus in 2019 (Turin, Italy) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Turin is a major city in northern Italy, but it has never been the host city for the Summer Olympic Games. The Summer Olympics have been held in Italy twice, but in different cities:

1) 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome

A:No, it is not true that the city where Christian Pulisic played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

In 2019, Christian Pulisic played for Borussia Dortmund, which is a professional soccer club based in Dortmund, Germany. The city of Dortmund hosted some football (soccer) matches during the 1972 Summer Olympics, which were held in Munich, West Germany.

So, while Dortmund itself was not the main host city for those Olympic Games, it did serve as one of the venues for the football tournament. Therefore, the statement that the city where Pulisic played in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect.

A:Yes, the city where Franck Kessié played for A.C. Milan in 2019 is Milan, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960.

Milan, the capital city of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, was the host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics. The Games were held from August 25 to September 11, 1960, and marked the first time that the Olympic Games were held in Italy.

Some key facts about the 1960 Summer Olympics in Milan:

- The opening and closing ceremonies took place at the San Siro Stadium (now known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza), which was also the main venue for the football (soccer) tournament.

- Other venues included the Vigorelli Velodrome for cycling events and the Palazzo dello Sport for basketball and boxing.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, Marc Roca played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?

2. The 1992 Summer Paralympic Games were also hosted in Barcelona after the Olympics.

However, Marc Roca's club Espanyol is a different team from FC Barcelona, which is the more famous club from the city. So while Barcelona hosted the 1992 Olympics, it was not the city where Roca's specific club was based and played in 2019.
Gold Answer: yes

Tomáš Souček played for Slavia Prague in 2019, which is a soccer club based in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic. Prague hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1912.

The 1912 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad, were held in Stockholm, Sweden, with the exception of the equestrian events, which took place in Stockholm's neighboring city, Nynäshamn. However, the Olympic football tournament was organized separately by the Swedish Olympic Committee and held in Stockholm, but also in other Swedish cities, including Gothenburg, Norrköping, Hälsingborg, and Gävle. Additionally, the Olympic tennis tournament was held in Båstad, Sweden.

So, while the main events of the 1912 Summer Olympics were held in Stockholm, some of the sporting events, including the football (soccer) tournament, took place in other Swedish cities, but not in Prague.

The Summer Olympics have been held in Germany twice - in Berlin in 1936 and in Munich in 1972, but never in Leipzig.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, M. Zárate played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where M. Zárate played soccer in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics.

Based on the information provided, it seems that M. Zárate played for a soccer club in 2019, but the specific city or club is not mentioned. Without knowing the city or club name, it's impossible to definitively say whether that city has hosted the Summer Olympics or not.

Most professional soccer clubs are based in cities that have not hosted the Summer Olympics, as hosting such a major international event requires significant infrastructure and resources that only a relatively small number of cities around the world possess.

So unless additional context is provided indicating that M. Zárate played for a club in a city that is known to have hosted the Summer Olympics (e.g., London, Barcelona, Mexico City, etc.), the safer assumption is that the city where he played in 2019 did not host the Olympics.

Itumeleng Khune is a South African professional soccer player who has played as a goalkeeper for Kaizer Chiefs, a club based in Johannesburg, South Africa, for most of his career. Johannesburg has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

However, without knowing specifically which club Khune played for in 2019, I cannot definitively say whether that city has hosted the Olympics or not.

Gold Answer: no
Gold Entity: SV Werder Bremen, bremen,

Nuri Şahin played for Werder Bremen in the German Bundesliga in 2019. Werder Bremen is based in the city of Bremen, Germany.

The city of Berlin, Germany hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1936.

So the statement that the city where Nuri Şahin played in 2019 (Bremen) never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect, because while Bremen itself has not hosted the Olympics, it is located in Germany, which did host the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

A:I'm unsure if the city where the soccer club Capa played in 2019 hosted the Summer Olympics. The question doesn't provide enough information for me to definitively determine that. A few reasons why I'm unsure:

1) I don't have information about which city Capa played in during 2019. Soccer clubs can be based in different cities.

2) Even if the city was named, I don't have comprehensive data about which cities have hosted the Summer Olympics throughout history.

3) The phrasing "the city, where the soccer club, Capa played for in 2019, is located in" is a bit convoluted, making it harder to parse exactly what is being asked.

A:No, the city where Mahmoud Dahoud played for Borussia Dortmund in 2019 (Dortmund, Germany) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

The Summer Olympic Games have been held in Germany twice, but in different cities:

Mahmoud Dahoud is a German professional soccer player who played for Borussia Dortmund in 2019. Borussia Dortmund is a club based in Dortmund, Germany.

The city of Dortmund hosted some soccer matches during the 1972 Summer Olympics, which were held in Munich, West Germany (now Germany). While Dortmund did not host the Olympic Games itself, it served as one of the host cities for the soccer tournament.

So, the statement that the city where Dahoud played in 2019 (Dortmund) never hosted the Summer Olympics is incorrect because Dortmund did host Olympic soccer matches during the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Bologna hosted some football matches during the 1960 Summer Olympics, which were held in Rome, Italy. Several other Italian cities like Naples, Florence and Turin also hosted some Olympic events in 1960 in addition to Rome.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, Joelinton played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Joelinton played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

J. Ikoné played for Lille OSC in 2019, which is a professional soccer club based in Lille, France. The city of Lille hosted several soccer matches during the 1924 Summer Olympics.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, J. Lens played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where the French soccer club RC Lens played in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics.

RC Lens is a professional soccer club based in Lens, a city in northern France. Lens has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The Olympic Games have been held in France on three occasions, but all in Paris (1900, 1924, and 2024 - the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics will be held in Paris).

1005-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, J. Lens played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:Yes, it is true that the city where the soccer club RC Lens played in 2019, which is Lens, France, has never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Lens is a city in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is a relatively small city with a population of around 30,000 people. The Summer Olympic Games have traditionally been hosted by larger, more prominent cities with the infrastructure and resources to accommodate such a massive international event.

The Summer Olympics have been held in France on three occasions, but never in Lens. Paris hosted the Games in 1900 and 1924, while Lille, a larger city in northern France, co-hosted some events during the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Unless I'm missing some obscure historical fact, there is no record of Lens ever hosting the Summer Olympic Games. The city's primary claim to fame is being home to the RC Lens soccer club, which plays in the top-tier Ligue 1 in France.

Alan Dzagoev is a Russian professional soccer player who played for CSKA Moscow in 2019. Moscow, the capital city of Russia, hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics.

So while Vigo itself has not hosted the Olympics, the country where Celta Vigo is based (Spain) has hosted the Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Barcelona in 1992.

1155-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, R. Borré played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Rafael Santos Borré played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Borré played for River Plate in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2019. Buenos Aires hosted the 1951 Pan American Games, but it has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

The city that has hosted the Summer Olympics and where Borré played in 2019 is Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.

So the statement "the city, where the soccer club, R. Borré played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics" is false because Rio de Janeiro, where Borré played for River Plate on loan in 2019, did host the 2016 Summer Olympics.

1157-1th question
Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, D. Calvert-Lewin played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Dominic Calvert-Lewin played for in 2019 (which is Liverpool for Everton FC) never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Liverpool hosted the 2022 Summer Olympics in 1948. These were the first Summer Olympics held after World War II and were officially known as the Games of the XIV Olympiad.

Some key facts about the 1948 London Olympics hosted in Liverpool:

- They took place from July 29 to August 14, 1948.
- 59 nations participated, sending a total of 4,104 athletes (3,714 men and 390 women).
- The main venues were at Wembley Stadium in London, but several events were held at other venues around England, including Sefton Park in Liverpool which hosted the athletics walking events.

So while the main Olympic stadium was in London, Liverpool did serve as one of the host cities for certain events during the 1948 Summer Olympics. Therefore, the statement that Liverpool never hosted the Olympics is incorrect.

A:No, the city where Nahitan Nández played for Boca Juniors in 2019 (Buenos Aires, Argentina) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

The Summer Olympics have been held in Buenos Aires, Argentina:

- Buenos Aires submitted bids to host the 1936, 1956, 1968, and 1976 Summer Olympics, but was not selected as the host city for any of those Games.

- The only Olympic events held in Buenos Aires were the 1951 Pan American Games, which served as a regional multi-sport event rather than the full Olympic Games.

A:No, the city where the Turkish soccer club S. Kırıntılı played in 2019 did not host the Summer Olympics.

S. Kırıntılı is a football club based in Kırıntı, a small town in the Kırklareli Province of northwestern Turkey. Kırıntı is a relatively small and obscure town, and it has never hosted an event as large as the Summer Olympic Games.

The Summer Olympics are major international multi-sport events that require extensive infrastructure, facilities, and resources to host. These games are typically held in major cities or metropolitan areas that have the necessary venues, accommodation, transportation, and other amenities to support such a massive undertaking.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, E. Choupo-Moting played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting played for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2019 is Paris, France, and Paris has never hosted the Summer Olympic Games.

The Summer Olympics have been held in France three times, but all in different cities:

1900 - Paris hosted some events, but the main host was Paris Suburb
1924 - Paris hosted some events, but the main host was Paris Suburb
1968 - Grenoble hosted the Winter Olympics, not the Summer Olympics
1992 - The Summer Olympics were held in Barcelona, Spain
2024 - Paris is scheduled to host the Summer Olympics

So while Paris is a major city that has hosted some Olympic events, it has never been the sole host city for the entire Summer Olympic Games. The city where Choupo-Moting's club PSG is based has not hosted the full Summer Olympics.

Q: Did the city, where the soccer club, R. Ruidíaz played for in 2019, is located in, hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, the city where Raúl Ruidíaz played for Seattle Sounders FC in 2019 (Seattle, Washington) has not hosted the Summer Olympics.

Seattle is a major city in the state of Washington, United States, but it has never been the host city for the Summer Olympic Games. The United States has hosted the Summer Olympics four times, but in different cities:

1904 - St. Louis, Missouri
1932 - Los Angeles, California 
1984 - Los Angeles, California
1996 - Atlanta, Georgia
2028 - Los Angeles, California (future host)

So while Seattle is a major metropolitan area and sports city in the U.S., it has not had the opportunity to host the prestigious Summer Olympic Games.

Q: Is it true that the city, where the soccer club, R. Ruidíaz played for in 2019, is located in, never hosted the Summer Olympics?
A:No, it is not true that the city where Raúl Ruidíaz played for a soccer club in 2019 never hosted the Summer Olympics.

Ruidíaz played for Seattle Sounders FC in 2019, which is based in Seattle, Washington, United States. Seattle hosted the 1990 Goodwill Games, which were an international multi-sport event organized by the United States to replicate the Olympic Games experience during the final years of the Cold War when the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

While the Goodwill Games were not the official Olympic Games, they were held in Seattle and involved many of the same sports and athletes that would have participated in the Olympics that year. So while Seattle has never officially hosted the Summer Olympic Games, it did host a major international multi-sport event in 1990 that was intended to serve as an Olympic-style competition.
