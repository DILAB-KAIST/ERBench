But from the data I have access to, it does appear to be true that no major/well-known artists had a song called "It's You or No One" in 1954.

Q: Is there an artist or group who sang a song titled choo choo ch'boogie in 1974?
A:No, there does not appear to be an artist or group that sang a song titled "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" in 1974.
