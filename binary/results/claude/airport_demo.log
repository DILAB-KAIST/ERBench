Q: Is there an airport located at latitude 19.5669994354 and longitude 5.75?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at the exact coordinates latitude 19.5669994354 and longitude 5.75.

Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude 5.87615 and longitude -71.8866?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no major airports located precisely at the coordinates latitude 5.87615 and longitude -71.8866.

Those coordinates point to a remote area in the Amazon rainforest region of southern Venezuela, near the border with Colombia. This is a very rural, undeveloped area of dense tropical rainforest with no major cities or airports nearby.

The closest airport of any size appears to be Tomas Higuera Airport (IATA: PNR) in Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela, which is over 200 km away from those coordinates. So unless there is a very small, unregistered airstrip in that jungle location, there does not seem to be an airport at that exact latitude and longitude.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude -22.8086109161 and longitude -55.5333328247?
A:No, there does not appear to be an airport located at those exact coordinates of latitude -22.8086109161 and longitude -55.5333328247.

However, I'm a bit unsure because those coordinates have quite a few decimal places of precision, so it's possible there is a very small private airstrip or something extremely local that I'm not catching. But there does not seem to be a publicly listed commercial or major airport right at those exact coordinates in that part of Brazil.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude 5.3513851166 and longitude -4.4034576416?
A:No, there does not appear to be an airport located at the exact coordinates latitude 5.3513851166 and longitude -4.4034576416.

Those coordinates place the location in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Liberia in West Africa. The nearest major airport would be Roberts International Airport (ROB) in Monrovia, Liberia, which is over 200 km away from those coordinates.

Given the location in the open ocean, it is highly unlikely there would be an airport situated at precisely those coordinates. I cannot definitively rule out some kind of small private airstrip on an offshore platform or ship, but there does not seem to be a commercial airport there based on available data.

Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude 5.3513851166 and longitude -4.4034576416?

Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude -25.5 and longitude 117.1669998169?
A:I'm not completely sure if there is an airport located at those exact coordinates of latitude -25.5 and longitude 117.1669998169. Those coordinates place the location in a remote area of Western Australia, near the town of Leinster.

Many smaller regional airports and airfields exist in remote parts of Australia, so it's possible there could be a small airport or airstrip in that vicinity, but I don't have definitive information confirming the presence of an airport at precisely those coordinates. My recommendation would be to check aviation charts or databases for that specific area to verify if an airport exists there. Without being able to conclusively confirm or deny, I'll have to respond "unsure" about whether an airport is located at those exact coordinates.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude 15.3000001907 and longitude 42.6829986572?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at the exact coordinates latitude 15.3000001907 and longitude 42.6829986572.

Those coordinates place the location in the Red Sea, off the western coast of Yemen. The nearest major airport would be Bisha Regional Airport in Saudi Arabia, which is still over 200 km away from those coordinates.

Given the level of precision provided in the coordinates, down to fractions of arcseconds, if there was a major airport there I would expect to be able to identify it. But there does not seem to be any airport or airfield at that precise location in the Red Sea.

Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude 15.3000001907 and longitude 42.6829986572?
A:I'm unsure if there is an airport located precisely at those coordinates of latitude 15.3000001907 and longitude 42.6829986572.

Those coordinates place the location in the Red Sea, off the western coast of Yemen. There are no major airports located directly in the Red Sea itself.

However, without additional research, I cannot definitively say whether there is a very small airport or airstrip located exactly on that coordinate point on one of the islands or coastal areas near there. Most maps and airport databases do not provide that level of precision for remote locations.

So in summary, while it seems highly unlikely there is a full airport at that exact coordinate point in the Red Sea, I cannot state it as an absolute certainty without further investigation. My response has to be "unsure" given the very precise coordinate provided.

However, it's possible there is a smaller private or municipal airport at that exact location that I'm not aware of. Without being able to definitively confirm the presence or absence of an airport there, I'll have to answer "unsure" for this set of coordinates. Let me know if you need any additional details!

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude -22.4291667938 and longitude -55.5333328247?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at those precise coordinates of latitude -22.4291667938 and longitude -55.5333328247.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude -25.8332996368 and longitude 139.6499938965?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at the exact coordinates latitude -25.8332996368 and longitude 139.6499938965.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude 5.6570000648 and longitude 44.3499984741?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at the exact coordinates latitude 5.6570000648 and longitude 44.3499984741.

Those coordinates place the location in the Indian Ocean, off the northeastern coast of Somalia, near the island nation of Socotra (which is territory of Yemen).

The nearest airport to those coordinates would likely be one of the airports in Somalia, such as Mogadishu International Airport or Hargeisa International Airport, but they are several hundred kilometers away from the specified coordinates over open ocean.

So unless there is a very small, unlisted airport or airstrip on one of the tiny islands in that area, it is safe to say there are no major airports precisely at those coordinates in the Indian Ocean off the Horn of Africa.

Given that the provided coordinates do not precisely match a known airport location in that region of Afghanistan, I would conclude there is likely no airport at those exact coordinates. However, I cannot be 100% certain without more detailed geographic data for that area.

Q: Is there an airport located at latitude 44.5458450365 and longitude -65.7854247093?
A:No, there does not appear to be a major airport located at the exact coordinates latitude 44.5458450365 and longitude -65.7854247093.

Those coordinates place the location in the Atlantic Ocean, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

The nearest major airport to those coordinates would be Halifax Stanfield International Airport (YHZ) which is located inland at latitude 44.8807°N, longitude 63.5085°W, about 200 km northwest of the given coordinates.

So unless there is a very small, unlisted airport or private airstrip at that specific location over the ocean, then there is likely no airport at those exact coordinates you provided.

Q: Is it true that there are no airports located at latitude -30.3666992188 and longitude 117.1330032349?
A:I'm not completely sure, but based on those coordinates, it does not appear there is a major commercial airport located precisely at latitude -30.3666992188 and longitude 117.1330032349.

Those coordinates place the location in a rural area northeast of the town of Merredin in Western Australia. The nearest airport I could find is Merredin Regional Aerodrome, which is a small regional airport about 20km southwest of those exact coordinates.

Unless there is a very small private airstrip at that precise location, which is possible but unlikely given it's a remote rural area, then it seems there are no major airports right at those coordinates. But I can't say with 100% certainty without more thoroughly checking that exact spot.
