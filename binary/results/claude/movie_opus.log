A:No, there is no movie released in 2015 starring Christoph Waltz where Sam Mendes is the director.

Explanation:
In 2015, Christoph Waltz starred in the James Bond film "Spectre," which was indeed directed by Sam Mendes.

Explanation:
In 1999, Will Smith starred in the movie "Wild Wild West," which was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. However, this is the only movie that matches the criteria of being released in 1999, starring Will Smith, and directed by Barry Sonnenfeld.

Jimmy Bennett, born in 1996, was a child actor in 2007. Some of his notable roles in 2007 include "Evan Almighty" and "Hostage." However, "Evan Almighty" was directed by Tom Shadyac, but Bennett did not star in the film; he had a minor role.

In 2015, Amy Poehler starred in the animated film "Inside Out," which was directed by Pete Docter. However, this is the only movie that matches the criteria of being released in 2015, starring Amy Poehler, and directed by Pete Docter.

Therefore, the statement "there are no movies released in 2014 starring Angelina Jolie Pitt where Robert Stromberg is the director" is false, as "Maleficent" is a counterexample to this claim.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2007, starring Justin Timberlake where Chris Miller is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 2007 starring Justin Timberlake where Chris Miller is the director.

Explanation:
After searching Justin Timberlake's filmography, I found that he starred in two movies released in 2007: "Alpha Dog" and "Shrek the Third." However, neither of these movies was directed by Chris Miller.

"Alpha Dog" was directed by Nick Cassavetes, and "Shrek the Third" was co-directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui. While Chris Miller was involved in the latter, he was not the sole director.

Furthermore, I couldn't find any other movie released in 2007 that starred Justin Timberlake and was directed by Chris Miller.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2007, starring Justin Timberlake where Chris Miller is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2007 starring Justin Timberlake where Chris Miller is the director.

Explanation:
After searching through Justin Timberlake's filmography, I found that he starred in only one movie released in 2007, which was "Shrek the Third." The directors of "Shrek the Third" were Chris Miller and Raman Hui. However, this is a different Chris Miller than the one mentioned in the question.

The Chris Miller mentioned in the question is likely referring to the American filmmaker who has directed movies such as "Shrek the Third" (2007), "Puss in Boots" (2011), and "The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part" (2019). While he did co-direct "Shrek the Third" in 2007, Justin Timberlake did not star in that movie. Timberlake only voiced the character of Artie in the film.

Therefore, there are no movies released in 2007 that starred Justin Timberlake and were directed by Chris Miller.

"Life of Pi" is based on the novel of the same name by Yann Martel. The film tells the story of a young man named Pi Patel (played by Suraj Sharma) who survives a shipwreck and is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.

The movie was a critical and commercial success, earning over $600 million worldwide and receiving numerous accolades, including four Academy Awards (Best Director for Ang Lee, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects).

Therefore, the statement "there are no movies, released in 2012, starring Suraj Sharma where Ang Lee is the director" is incorrect, as "Life of Pi" is a clear counterexample.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2016 starring Chris Hemsworth where Cedric Nicolas-Troyan is the director.

Explanation:
In 2006, Robin Williams starred in five movies: "RV", "The Night Listener", "Everyone's Hero", "Man of the Year", and "Night at the Museum". However, none of these films were directed by Shawn Levy.

Explanation:
After searching through Chazz Palminteri's and Rob Minkoff's filmographies, I couldn't find any movie where they collaborated in 1999.

In 1999, Chazz Palminteri appeared in the movies "Analyze This" and "Stuart Little," but neither of these films was directed by Rob Minkoff.

Rob Minkoff directed the movie "Stuart Little" in 1999, which featured Chazz Palminteri in a voice role. However, Palminteri was not the star of the film, as the question suggests.

Rob Minkoff directed the movie "Stuart Little" in 1999, which featured Chazz Palminteri as a voice actor. However, since the question specifically asks about Palminteri starring in the movie, and voice acting is generally not considered as "starring," this movie does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, based on the available information, there are no movies released in 1999 that star Chazz Palminteri and are directed by Rob Minkoff.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2009 starring Robert Downey Jr. where Guy Ritchie is the director.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2000, starring Larry Miller where Peter Segal is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 2000 starring Larry Miller where Peter Segal is the director.

Explanation:
After searching through Larry Miller's filmography and Peter Segal's directorial works, I couldn't find any movie that matches the given criteria. 

In 2000, Larry Miller appeared in a few movies, such as "Best in Show" and "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps," but none of these were directed by Peter Segal.

Peter Segal directed two movies in 2000: "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" and "My Fellow Americans." While Larry Miller was part of the cast in "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps," he wasn't one of the starring actors. The main stars were Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson, and Larry Miller had a supporting role.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 1997, starring Robin Williams where Les Mayfield is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1997 starring Robin Williams where Les Mayfield is the director.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 1996, starring Bill Murray where Joe Pytka is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1996 starring Bill Murray where Joe Pytka is the director.

In 1996, Bill Murray starred in the movie "Larger Than Life" directed by Howard Franklin. He also had a cameo appearance in "Kingpin" directed by the Farrelly brothers. 

Joe Pytka, on the other hand, directed the movie "Space Jam" in 1996, which starred Michael Jordan and featured Bill Murray in a supporting role. However, "Space Jam" was released in November 1996, not February 1996.

Therefore, while Bill Murray and Joe Pytka did collaborate on a movie in 1996, it was not released in February of that year, and there are no other movies from 1996 that match the criteria mentioned in the question.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 1998, starring Harrison Ford where Ivan Reitman is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1998 starring Harrison Ford where Ivan Reitman is the director.

"Random Hearts," the other Harrison Ford movie from 1998, was not directed by Ivan Reitman, but by Sydney Pollack.

Therefore, the statement "there are no movies, released in 1998, starring Harrison Ford where Ivan Reitman is the director" is true, as the only movie that meets the criteria of starring Harrison Ford and being directed by Ivan Reitman in 1998 is "Six Days, Seven Nights," but the statement specifically says there are no such movies.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2015 starring Henry Cavill where Guy Ritchie is the director.

In 2015, Henry Cavill starred in the movie "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", which was directed by Guy Ritchie. However, this movie was released in August 2015, not in 2015 as the question specifies.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2008, starring Matthew McConaughey where Andy Tennant is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2008 starring Matthew McConaughey where Andy Tennant is the director.

Explanation:
After searching through Matthew McConaughey's filmography, I found that he starred in two movies released in 2008: "Fool's Gold" and "Surfer, Dude." However, neither of these movies was directed by Andy Tennant.

"Fool's Gold" was directed by Andy Tennant, but it was released in February 2008, and Kate Hudson was the co-star, not Matthew McConaughey.

"Surfer, Dude" was released in September 2008 and starred Matthew McConaughey, but it was directed by S.R. Bindler, not Andy Tennant.

Therefore, there are no movies released in 2008 that match the criteria of starring Matthew McConaughey and being directed by Andy Tennant.

"Wyatt Earp" was directed by Lawrence Kasdan, but it was released in 1994 and starred Kevin Costner, not Dennis Quaid.

Dennis Quaid and Lawrence Kasdan did collaborate on the movie "Dreamscape" in 1984, but this was released a decade earlier than the specified year, 1994.

Therefore, based on the information available, there are no movies released in 1994 that star Dennis Quaid and were directed by Lawrence Kasdan.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2012, starring Anna Kendrick where Chris Butler is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2012 starring Anna Kendrick where Chris Butler is the director.

Explanation:
In 2012, Anna Kendrick starred in several movies, including "Pitch Perfect," "End of Watch," "The Company You Keep," and "What to Expect When You're Expecting." However, none of these movies were directed by Chris Butler.

Therefore, the statement is true, as there is no overlap between Anna Kendrick's acting roles in 2012 and Chris Butler's directorial work.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 1999, starring Steven Anthony Lawrence where Donald Petrie is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 1999 starring Steven Anthony Lawrence where Donald Petrie is the director.

Explanation:
Steven Anthony Lawrence is an American actor best known for his role as Beans in the Disney Channel series "Even Stevens" (2000-2003). He was born in 1990, so he would have been only 9 years old in 1999.

Donald Petrie is an American film director who has directed several movies, but none of them were released in 1999 or starred Steven Anthony Lawrence. Some of his notable works include "Mystic Pizza" (1988), "Grumpy Old Men" (1993), and "Miss Congeniality" (2000).

Given the actor's young age in 1999 and the lack of a matching film in the director's filmography, it is clear that no such movie exists.

Steven Anthony Lawrence is an American actor best known for his role as Beans in the Disney Channel series "Even Stevens" (2000-2003). He was born in 1990, so he would have been only 9 years old in 1999.

"Jack Frost" was directed by Troy Miller, and "Holy Man" was directed by Stephen Herek. So, while Kelly Preston and Stephen Herek did work together on a movie released in 1998, Preston did not star in it, and Herek did not direct any movies released that year in which Preston starred.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1989 starring Sylvester Stallone where Andrey Konchalovskiy is the director.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 1996, starring Robert De Niro where Tony Scott is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1996 starring Robert De Niro where Tony Scott is the director.

Explanation:
In 1996, Robert De Niro starred in several movies, including:
1. The Fan (directed by Tony Scott)

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2007, starring Eddie Redmayne where Shekhar Kapur is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 2007 starring Eddie Redmayne where Shekhar Kapur is the director.

2. Shekhar Kapur, an Indian filmmaker, has directed several notable films, such as "Elizabeth" (1998) and its sequel "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" (2007). However, Eddie Redmayne did not appear in either of these films.

3. Upon reviewing Eddie Redmayne's filmography, there is no record of him collaborating with Shekhar Kapur on any film project, particularly in the year 2007.

Therefore, based on the available information, it is accurate to state that there are no movies released in 2007 starring Eddie Redmayne where Shekhar Kapur served as the director.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2003, starring Todd Giebenhain where Martin Brest is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 2003 starring Todd Giebenhain where Martin Brest is the director.

After searching through Todd Giebenhain's filmography, I could not find any movie he starred in that was released in 2003.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 1999, starring Matt Price where Milos Forman is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 1999 starring Matt Price where Milos Forman is the director.

After searching through Milos Forman's filmography, I couldn't find any movie he directed in 1999. The closest film to that year was "Man on the Moon" released in 1999, but it starred Jim Carrey, not Matt Price.

Additionally, when searching for Matt Price's filmography, I couldn't find any relevant information about an actor by that name starring in a movie in 1999, let alone one directed by Milos Forman.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1995 starring Robert De Niro where Martin Scorsese is the director.

Q: Is there a movie, released in 2005, starring Taylor Lautner where Robert Rodriguez is the director?
A:No, there is no movie released in 2005 starring Taylor Lautner where Robert Rodriguez is the director.

Explanation:
Taylor Lautner was born on February 11, 1992, which means he would have been only 13 years old in 2005. His acting career began with minor roles in the early 2000s, but his breakthrough role was as Jacob Black in the Twilight movie series, which started in 2008.

Robert Rodriguez, on the other hand, did direct a movie in 2005 called "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D," but Taylor Lautner was not part of the cast. Lautner later worked with Rodriguez in the 2010 movie "Valentine's Day" and the 2020 movie "We Can Be Heroes."

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2005 starring Taylor Lautner where Robert Rodriguez is the director.

Explanation:
Taylor Lautner, born in 1992, was only 13 years old in 2005. He had not yet risen to fame, which happened after his role in the Twilight movie series, starting in 2008. In 2005, Lautner had only appeared in a few minor roles in TV shows and movies.

Robert Rodriguez, on the other hand, was an established director in 2005, but he did not direct any films that year. His film releases closest to 2005 were "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" (2003), "Sin City" (2005), and "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D" (2005), none of which starred Taylor Lautner.

While Andrew Bergman did direct Demi Moore in "Striptease" in 1996, he did not direct her in any other movie that year. Therefore, the statement "there are no movies, released in 1996, starring Demi Moore where Andrew Bergman is the director" is false, as "Striptease" is an exception to this claim.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 1994 starring Meryl Streep where Curtis Hanson is the director.

Explanation:
After searching through Meryl Streep's filmography, I found that she appeared in two movies released in 1994: "The River Wild" and "The House of the Spirits." However, neither of these films was directed by Curtis Hanson.

"The River Wild" was directed by Curtis Hanson, but it was released in 1994 and did not star Meryl Streep. The lead actress in that movie was Meryl Streep.

"The House of the Spirits" was released in 1994 and starred Meryl Streep, but it was directed by Bille August, not Curtis Hanson.

Therefore, there are no movies that match the given criteria of being released in 1994, starring Meryl Streep, and directed by Curtis Hanson.

Jeff Bridges did work with Michael Cimino on the 1974 movie "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot," but that was released before 1980.

In 1980, Jeff Bridges appeared in the movie "Heaven's Gate," but it was directed by Michael Cimino, not starring Bridges.

Therefore, there is no movie released in 1980 that matches the criteria of starring Jeff Bridges and being directed by Michael Cimino.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2006, starring Sophia Myles where Len Wiseman is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2006 starring Sophia Myles where Len Wiseman is the director.

Explanation:
Len Wiseman directed two movies in 2006: "Underworld: Evolution" and "Live Free or Die Hard." Sophia Myles did not appear in either of these films.

Sophia Myles starred in "Tristan & Isolde" and "Art School Confidential" in 2006, but neither of these movies was directed by Len Wiseman.

Although Sophia Myles and Len Wiseman have collaborated on the "Underworld" franchise, with Myles starring in the first two films and Wiseman directing them, their collaboration in this series did not occur in 2006. "Underworld" was released in 2003, and "Underworld: Evolution" (2006) did not feature Myles.

In 2014, Liam Neeson starred in several movies, including "Non-Stop," "A Million Ways to Die in the West," and "Taken 3." However, none of these films were directed by Seth MacFarlane.

Seth MacFarlane, on the other hand, directed "A Million Ways to Die in the West" in 2014, but Liam Neeson did not star in this movie. MacFarlane himself played the lead role alongside Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris.

Therefore, while both Liam Neeson and Seth MacFarlane were involved in movies released in 2014, they did not collaborate on a project where Neeson starred and MacFarlane directed.

In 1996, Al Pacino starred in the film "Looking for Richard," which he also directed. He did not appear in any other films released that year.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2000 starring Sylvester Stallone where Stephen Kay is the director.

Explanation:
In 2000, Sylvester Stallone starred in the movie "Get Carter," which was directed by Stephen Kay. However, this is the only movie that matches the criteria of being released in 2000, starring Stallone, and directed by Kay.

A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2002 starring Angelina Jolie Pitt where Stephen Herek is the director.

Explanation:
Mathieu Kassovitz and Jean-Pierre Jeunet have collaborated on a movie, but it was not released in 2001. The movie they worked on together is "Amélie" (original French title: "Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"), which was released in 2001. However, in this movie, Mathieu Kassovitz was not an actor but a co-writer along with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who directed the film.

In 2001, Mathieu Kassovitz starred in the movie "Birthday Girl" directed by Jez Butterworth, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed "Amélie" but did not cast Kassovitz in an acting role.

1. Gone Baby Gone (2007)
2. The Town (2010)

After searching through the filmographies of both Jon Favreau and Seth Gordon, I could not find any movies that were released in 2013 where Jon Favreau starred and Seth Gordon directed.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2005, starring Shannon Elizabeth where Wes Craven is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2005 starring Shannon Elizabeth where Wes Craven is the director.

Explanation:
After searching through Shannon Elizabeth's filmography, I found that she appeared in two movies released in 2005: "Cursed" and "The Kid & I." However, neither of these films was directed by Wes Craven.

Therefore, there is no movie released in 2005 that matches the criteria of starring Shannon Elizabeth and being directed by Wes Craven.

"Wimbledon" was indeed directed by Richard Loncraine, but it was released on September 17, 2004, in the United Kingdom and September 24, 2004, in the United States. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of the question, which specifically asks about movies released in 2004.

"Moneyball" was directed by Bennett Miller, not Terrence Malick.

Q: Is it true that there are no movies, released in 2000, starring Liam Aiken where Hugh Hudson is the director?
A:Yes, it is true that there are no movies released in 2000 starring Liam Aiken where Hugh Hudson is the director.

Explanation:
Liam Aiken, born in 1990, was only 10 years old in 2000. His acting career began in the late 1990s, but his first major role was in the 2002 film "Road to Perdition." 

Hugh Hudson, a British film director, did not direct any films in 2000. His last film before 2000 was "My Life So Far" (1999), and his next film after 2000 was "I Dreamed of Africa" (2000). Neither of these films starred Liam Aiken.

Given the young age of Liam Aiken in 2000 and the fact that Hugh Hudson did not direct any films that year, it is safe to conclude that there are no movies from 2000 that match the given criteria.
