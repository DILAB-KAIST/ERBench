It's worth noting that latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to locate points on the Earth's surface, but they do not necessarily correspond to a specific address or location. It's important to consider other factors, such as the proximity to landmasses, roads, and other infrastructure, when trying to determine the location of a place.

Therefore, it is unlikely that an airport exists at this location. However, without more information or up-to-date data, it is possible that there may be a small airstrip or helipad nearby that serves a specific purpose, such as a research station or a remote island community.
