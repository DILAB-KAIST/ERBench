Q: Is it true that there is a book written by Allende, Isabel and Peden, Margaret Sayers (TRN) that was published in May, 1995?

It is possible that there is a book written by one or more of these authors that was published in May, 1995, but without more specific information, it is impossible to say for certain. It is also possible that the book in question is a work of fiction, and that the authors did not actually write it together. Without more information, it is difficult to say for certain.
