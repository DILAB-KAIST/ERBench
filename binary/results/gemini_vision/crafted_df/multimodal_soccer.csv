In 2019, the club had a number of players from Italy, including Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, and José Callejón. However, none of these players wore the number 62 shirt.
The number 62 shirt is not a common number for footballers to wear. In fact, it is one of the least used numbers in Serie A. This is because the number 62 is often associated with the reserve team or the youth team.
There are a few reasons why the number 62 is not a popular number for footballers to wear. One reason is that it is not a very lucky number. In some cultures, the number 62 is associated with death and misfortune. Another reason is that the number 62 is not a very aesthetically pleasing number. It is not a round number, and it does not have a nice symmetry.
Despite the fact that the number 62 is not a popular number for footballers to wear, there have been a few players who have worn it with distinction. One of the most famous players to wear the number 62 is Roberto Baggio. Baggio is a former Italian footballer who played for a number of clubs, including Juventus, AC Milan, and Inter Milan. He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time.
Another famous player to wear the number 62 is Andrea Pirlo. Pirlo is a former Italian footballer who played for a number of clubs, including Juventus, AC Milan, and New York City FC. He is considered to be one of the greatest midfielders of all time.
Although there are a few famous players who have worn the number 62, it is still not a very popular number for footballers to wear. This is likely due to the fact that it is not a very lucky number and it is not a very aesthetically pleasing number.
