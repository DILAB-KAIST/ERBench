Publishers typically require authors to provide their names and other identifying information as part of the publishing process. Additionally, books are typically published with a copyright notice that includes the author's name and the date of publication. Without this information, it would be difficult to determine the authorship and publication date of a book.It is possible that a book could have been published anonymously or under a pseudonym, but it is still unlikely that a book would be published without any identifying information about the author.

""Unknown"" is a vague term that can refer to anyone who hasn't been identified or is not famous. It's improbable that no books were published in January 2002 by an unknown author because many books are published every day by various authors, and many of them might not be well-known or famous.Additionally, it's important to note that publishing companies and literary agencies receive numerous book submissions from new and unpublished authors daily.
