96, Is there an artist or group who sang a song titled don't be afraid (mi fovasai) in 2012?,48,0,no,"there isn't an artist or group who sang a song titled ""don't be afraid (mi fovasai)"" in 2012.My reasoning for this answer is that ""Mi Fovasai"" is a song by the Greek artist Eleftheria Eleftheriou, which was released in 2012. However, the title of the song is not ""Don't Be Afraid,"" but rather ""Mi Fovasai,"" which means ""Don't Be Afraid"" in Greek. Therefore, while there is a song with a similar title, it is not the same song that the question is asking about.
