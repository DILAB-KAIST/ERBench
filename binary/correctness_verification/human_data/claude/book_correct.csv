2," Is there a book written by Collins, Wilkie and Connolly, Joy that was published in August, 2005?",1,0,no,"i could not find any book co-written by wilkie collins and joy connolly that was published in august 2005.Wilkie Collins was a famous English novelist who lived from 1824 to 1889, so it seems highly unlikely he would have co-authored a book published in 2005. Joy Connolly appears to be a contemporary author, but I did not find any collaborative works between her and the long-deceased Wilkie Collins, especially not one from 2005.
Unless there is some very obscure or self-published work I'm missing, it does not seem there was a book written by this author pairing in August 2005. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details!

3," Is it true that there are no books written by Collins, Wilkie and Connolly, Joy that were published in August, 2005?",1,1,unsure,"i do not have enough definitive information to say whether it is true or not that there are no books written by wilkie collins and joy connolly published in august 2005.Wilkie Collins was a 19th century novelist who passed away in 1889, so it seems highly unlikely he would have a new book published in 2005, over 100 years after his death. However, it's possible a new edition or compilation of his existing works could have been published then.
As for Joy Connolly, without more context about who this author is, I cannot definitively say whether they did or did not have a book published in August 2005. Many authors share that name.
So in summary, my response is ""unsure"" because I don't have definitive information to confirm or deny the statement about those two authors having no books published in that specific month/year. More context would be needed to make a conclusive determination.
