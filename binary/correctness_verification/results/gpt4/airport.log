Model Result: Yes, it is true that there are no airports located at latitude 45.9110555555556 and longitude -91.6285. This location is in the middle of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin, USA. Airports require large, flat, open spaces for runways and other facilities, and they are typically not built in forested areas due to the difficulty of clearing land and the potential for wildlife hazards. Additionally, airports are usually built near populated areas for convenience, and this location is relatively remote.
