Peter Watts, on the other hand, is a contemporary Canadian science fiction author who was born in 1958. He would have been only eight years old in April 1966, which makes it highly unlikely that he would have translated or written any books at such a young age. Furthermore, there is no record of any collaboration between these two authors, which is not surprising given the significant difference in their lifetimes and genres.
