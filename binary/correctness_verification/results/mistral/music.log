Model Result: No, that is not true. There are many artists and groups that released songs in 2011 that were titled from their hearts. For example, Adele's hit song 'Rolling in the Deep' was inspired by her personal experiences and emotions.

It's important to note that the title of a song doesn't necessarily reflect the emotions or experiences that inspired it. Artists and groups can choose to title their songs in a variety of ways, including based on personal experiences, emotions, or themes.
