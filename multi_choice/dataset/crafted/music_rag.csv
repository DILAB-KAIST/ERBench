1,elegie,patti smith,1975,pop/rock,"Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith. It was released by Arista Records on November 10, 1975. A fixture of the mid-1970s underground rock music scene in New York City, Smith signed to Arista in 1975 and recorded Horses with her band at Electric Lady Studios in August and September of that year. She enlisted former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the album.
The music on Horses was informed by the minimalist aesthetic of the punk rock genre, then in its formative years. Smith and her band composed the album's songs using simple chord progressions, while also breaking from punk tradition in their propensity for improvisation and embrace of ideas from avant-garde and other musical styles. Smith's lyrics on Horses were alternately rooted in her own personal experiences, particularly with her family, and in more fantastical imagery. The album also features adaptations of the rock standards ""Gloria"" and ""Land of a Thousand Dances"".
At the time of its release, Horses experienced modest commercial success and placed in the top 50 of the American Billboard 200 albums chart, while being widely acclaimed by music critics. Recognized as a seminal recording in the history of punk and later rock movements, Horses has frequently appeared in professional lists of the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation into the National Recording Registry as a ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" work."

13,that's the way love goes,janet jackson,1993,pop/rock,"""That's the Way Love Goes"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson from her fifth album, janet. (1993). The song was released on April 20, 1993, as the lead single from the Janet album. Written and produced by Jackson and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the song's themes of romantic lust saw Jackson transitioning to sensual territory, considered a shocking contrast to her previous releases among critics and the public. The song's slow tempo fused R&B, pop, funk and soul music with flourishes of downtempo and hip hop music.

""That's the Way Love Goes"" is one of Jackson's biggest hits in the United States.

It also topped the Hot 100 Airplay for ten weeks, as well as spending multiple weeks at number one on several of Billboard's other component charts. The song became the first and only single in history to debut at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart. Internationally, it placed at number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hungary, South Africa, Japan and Europe's Hot 100 chart. It is the seventeenth biggest hit of the 1990s and the biggest selling single by a female artist in South Africa. It has sold over three million copies worldwide. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA.
""That's the Way Love Goes"" received the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in addition to Billboard Awards, BMI Pop Award for Most Played Song, and American Music Awards. Its accompanying music video received several nominations at the MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video, and also influenced several videos, including releases from Ciara and Prince.
""That's the Way Love Goes"" has been recorded by artists such as Bruno Mars and NSYNC, cited as an influence by Britney Spears and Nelly Furtado, and inspired or been sampled in songs by Alicia Keys, Destiny's Child and Hikaru Utada.

In 2016, Radiohead released ""True Love Waits"" as the closing track on A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad. It received positive reviews, and Pitchfork named it among the greatest songs of the decade. Several critics felt the long wait made the studio version more powerful.

84,love don't live here anymore,faith evans,1995,pop/rock,"""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" is a song written by Miles Gregory and originally recorded by Rose Royce. It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for Whitfield Records. Lead vocals were sung by Gwen Dickey and the song was released as the second single from their third studio album Strikes Again. The song was developed as a result of producer Whitfield's interest to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British arranger and composer. Together they asked songwriter Miles Gregory to write a song for them. Gregory's undergoing medical care for his deteriorating physical health became the inspiration behind the song. ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" incorporated the use of the Pollard Syndrum TwinDrum, and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Dickey was present during the recording.
After its release, the song was critically appreciated, but was only moderately successful commercially. It reached a peak of 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and five on the Hot Black Singles chart. It achieved its highest position in both New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it reached number two. ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" has been covered by a number of artists, including Madonna, Morrissey–Mullen, Jimmy Nail, and Faith Evans. Madonna's version was included in her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and it was the idea of Michael Ostin, the head of the A&R department of Warner Bros. Records, that Madonna record a cover version of the song to include in the album. A remix of Madonna's cover was included in her 1995 ballad compilation album Something to Remember.
The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differ in that the latter uses more classical instruments. The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments. Critics were not impressed with the version present in Like a Virgin, calling it ""awful"", while they warmed to the version present in Something to Remember. However, it was a commercial disappointment, reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was promoted by a music video shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, which portrayed Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel, and was shot in a single take."

One of his best known songs, it was hugely successful in Europe. It was a number-one-hit in Norway and Sweden and placed at number 4 in the German charts, where it sold more than 250,000 units. This song was more successful in Europe than the United States (the song's pervasive sexual content made it unfit for broadcast on U.S. radio) and this is why it is only featured on the vinyl and European CD version of Zappa's best of compilation, Strictly Commercial (1995)."

159,(the man who shot) liberty valance,gene pitney,1972,pop/rock,"""(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance"" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, which was released by Gene Pitney in 1962. It spent 13 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 4, while reaching No. 2 on Canada's CHUM Hit Parade, and No. 4 on New Zealand's ""Lever Hit Parade"".Although it was not used in the film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, there is disagreement about whether the song had been intended to appear in it. Nevertheless, Pitney stated that the recording session was paid for by Paramount, and that it was midway through the effort when he found out that the song was not going to be included in the film; one of the orchestra members told him that the movie had been released.  Session drummer Gary Chester played on the recording.The Pitney and the Jimmie Rodgers versions of the song are noted for a solo violin that plays in the upper register. Both versions are noteworthy for the chorus, where a quick half-second strike on the tympani is heard, depicting the gun shots, which go:
""The man who shot Liberty Valance, (bong)
He shot Liberty Valance, (bong),
He was the bravest of them all"".
The first verse describes the outlaw's intimidating presence and ability with a gun, the second focuses on the man who comes to town prepared to defeat Valance with the law alone. Further along we learn how the law-book toting hero falls in love with a girl who, when he is forced to confront Valance, waits alone and prays, knowing that: ""When two men go and face (or ""fight"") each other, only one returns"". The lyrics generally parallel the film’s plot with some exceptions. In the film, Ransom Stoddard, the lawyer thought to have shot Valance, never remained in town because of “the love of a girl.” Stoddard stayed out of stubbornness. And although “the girl,” Hallie, was attracted to Stoddard more than to her beau, Tom Doniphon, and worried about Stoddard facing Valance, she is never depicted praying for Stoddard or discouraging him from dueling.
The song was ranked No. 36 in the Western Writers of America's list of the top 100 Western songs of all time, as compiled from a survey of its members.Jimmie Rodgers released a cover similar in form to the Gene Pitney version.
The Greg Kihn Band included their take on their 1980 album Glass House Rock.
James Taylor  recorded it for his 1985 album That's Why I'm Here.

Released as a single in June 1995, ""You Used to Love Me"" earned largely positive reviews. It peaked at number 24 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and reached the top five on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

It is regarded as one of country's most important standards. Williams was inspired to write the song while driving with his fiancée from Nashville, Tennessee, to Shreveport, Louisiana.

Produced by Fred Rose, Williams recorded the song at his last session at Castle Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, on September 23.
""Your Cheatin' Heart"" was released in January 1953. Propelled by Hank Williams' recent death during a trip to a New Year's concert in Canton, Ohio, the song became an instant success. It topped Billboard's Country & Western chart for six weeks, with over a million units sold. The success of the song continued with covers by other artists. Joni James' version reached number two on Billboard's Most Played in Jukeboxes the same year, while Ray Charles' 1962 version reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 13 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2011, Homme reissued Queens of the Stone Age through his Rekords Rekords label, having it remastered and adding three additional tracks–two from the album's recording sessions and one from two years earlier. The reissue received a positive critical response and was accompanied by a supporting concert tour. Working on the reissue and subsequent tour also inspired part of the band's approach to recording its sixth album, ...Like Clockwork, released in 2013.

283,it's going to take some time,carole king,1971,pop/rock,"""It's Going to Take Some Time"" is a song written by Carole King and Toni Stern for King’s 1971 album, Music. It was redone by the Carpenters in 1972 for their fourth album, A Song for You. According to Richard Carpenter, he had to choose which songs he wanted to remake, and there was a big pile of 7-inch singles he had to listen to. When he encountered ""It's Going to Take Some Time"", he knew it would be a hit, and recorded it. The song peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Tim Weisberg played the bass flute, but the flute solo was played by Bob Messenger on a (standard) alto flute.King is quoted as saying that the duo's lush, string-laden cover, including a flute solo, made her own more sparse version sound ""like a demo"".
According to musicologist James E. Perone, the lyrics describe someone recovering from a relationship that has ended.  They contrast the current situation, where the singer sings that ""it's going to take some time this time"" with her future recovery from the sadness.  Perone interprets the syncopations of much of the music as reflecting her recovery, but notes that the smoother, unsyncopated music at the end of each verse bring her back to the present day reality.Actress Jessie Mueller, who portrayed King in the Broadway musical Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, regards ""It's Going to Take Some Time"" as one of her favorite King songs, adding that King ""knows how to write a breakup song! She can encapsulate a feeling and mood so well, and with such depth and simplicity at the same time.""Jazz organist Richard ""Groove"" Holmes recorded an instrumental version on his 1973 album Night Glider.
The band Dishwalla covered the song on the 1994 tribute album, If I Were a Carpenter."

It was released as the second single from the album internationally. The song was released for digital download on June 17, 2011, and serviced to mainstream radios on August 16, 2011, in the United States, through Hollywood Records.
It was written by Antonina Armato and Tim James while both receive production credits under the stage-name Rock Mafia. Additional songwriting comes from Adam Schmalholz, while Devrim Karaoglu co-produced the track. The song, according to Gomez, was meant to sound different from her previous material, achieving a ""high fashion"" sound. ""Love You Like a Love Song"" is a midtempo electropop and dance-pop song with a Euro disco rhythm. The lyrics deal with a love relationship in its primary stage.
""Love You Like a Love Song"" was a success in North America, peaking at number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number ten on the Canadian Hot 100. It stands as the band's most successful single in the United States, lasting the longest on the chart, selling more than two million copies and earning a penta-platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song peaked at number one in Russia, inside the top ten in Hungary, Mexico and Slovakia, and earned gold certifications in Australia and Sweden, and a platinum one in Norway. It was the second-most-downloaded single of 2011 in Russia. In 2022, Billboard ranked the song as the biggest hit that peaked at number 22.
The music video for ""Love You Like a Love Song"" was directed by Geremy Jasper and Georgie Greville. It features Gomez performing the song at a Japanese karaoke bar while scenes of the band performing in different settings are intercut through the video. The video received controversy for the use of paint, later proven to be non-toxic, on a horse. Despite the use of non-toxic paint and supervision by the Humane Society, the scenes with the horses were removed in the final edit."

Recorded in East London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of lead single ""Brianstorm"" on 2 April 2007. It was the band’s first album with new bassist Nick O'Malley, replacing their previous bassist Andy Nicholson, who left the band shortly before the North American tour of the band's debut studio album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006). 
In comparison to their debut album, the album is considered more musically ambitious, with ambient sounds and expanded drum rhythms being introduced. As with their debut, Favourite Worst Nightmare was a widespread critical success, with critics highlighting the band's new emotional depth and frontman Alex Turner's matured songwriting. NME and Uncut ranked it the second-best album of 2007, while Dutch publication OOR named it the best of 2007. Retrospectively, the album is considered the start of the band's change of sound with each of their albums after their debut.
In its first week of release, the album sold over 227,000 copies in the United Kingdom, going straight to number one on the UK Albums Chart. ""Brianstorm"" and ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" were also both hits on the UK Singles Chart, with the former reaching number two on the chart. In the United States, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since been certified 4× platinum in the UK.

The album includes some tracks the band decided to not release on their debut EP Opiate. This is their only album to feature original bassist Paul D'Amour.
According to AllMusic, Undertow helped heavy metal remain prominent as a mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. AllMusic saw the album's success in the ""striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.""As of 2020, Undertow has sold over three million copies in the United States, and is certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

It is a more pop-orientated affair than the band's previous, Go 2 (1978), and was named for its emphasis on guitars (""wires"") and expansive-sounding drums. The album was their first issued in the United States and their first recorded with guitarist Dave Gregory, who had replaced keyboardist Barry Andrews earlier in 1979. It features a mix of pop, art rock, new wave and punk styles with much rhythmic interplay between XTC's two guitarists.
Bassist Colin Moulding's dissatisfaction with XTC's ""quirky"" reputation inspired the group to take a more accessible approach, starting with the non-album single ""Life Begins at the Hop"". Drums and Wires was recorded in four weeks at the newly built Town House studio in London with producer Steve Lillywhite and engineer Hugh Padgham, who were beginning to develop their signature gated reverb production technique, as demonstrated on the album opener and lead single ""Making Plans for Nigel"". Lyrically, the album focuses on the trappings or titillations of the modern world, with several songs about submitting to external forces. Frontman and guitarist Andy Partridge designed the cover artwork, which depicts the band logo forming the outline of a face.
Drums and Wires reached number 34 on the UK Albums Chart and number 176 on the US Billboard 200. ""Making Plans for Nigel"" reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and marked the band's commercial breakthrough. In 1980, Partridge recorded Take Away / The Lure of Salvage, an LP consisting mostly of dub remixes of Drums and Wires tracks. In later years, Drums and Wires became the best-known of XTC's albums.

It was released in July 1984 as the B-side of the third single from their Roll On album.  Though ""I'm Not That Way Anymore"" was released as the A-side, radio programmers preferred the flipside and the song became Alabama's 14th consecutive number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.During the first weeks the song was on the Billboard chart, ""I'm Not That Way Anymore"" charted concurrently, being listed as a tag-along B-side.  Since ""I'm Not That Way"" was intended as the A-side, the song had an accompanying music video which was filmed at Fort Payne High School.
The chorus references ""Faded Love"" by Texas musician Bob Wills and ""Louisiana Man"" by Doug Kershaw repeatedly throughout the song.
The song was used as the basis of ""If You're Gonna Run in Texas"", a radio campaign advertisement produced as part of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz's reelection campaign in 2018."

Lyricist Neil Peart has stated that the detailed imagery in the song intentionally evokes concentration camps of the Holocaust, although he left the lyrics ambiguous enough that they could deal with any similar prison camp scenario.
The song was inspired in part by Geddy Lee's mother's accounts of the Holocaust.
In a rare instance for Rush's music, the track features no bass guitar, with Lee instead completely focusing on synthesizers and vocals."

353,eight miles high,the byrds,1965,pop/rock,"""Eight Miles High"" is a song by the American rock band the Byrds, written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby. It was first released as a single on March 14, 1966. Musically influenced by sitar player Ravi Shankar and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, the song was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelia and raga rock. Accordingly, critics often cite ""Eight Miles High"" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era.
The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The band strenuously denied these allegations at the time, but in later years both Clark and Crosby admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their drug use. The failure of ""Eight Miles High"" to reach the Billboard Top 10 is usually attributed to the broadcasting ban, but some commentators have suggested the song's complexity and uncommercial nature were greater factors.
""Eight Miles High"" reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 24 on the UK Singles Chart.

It was released as the third single from their 1991 album Sailing the Seas of Cheese. Unlike its preceding singles ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" and ""Tommy the Cat"", ""Tweekers"" did not feature an accompanying video. The song opens with Larry LaLonde on guitar and a reserved bassline from Les Claypool, from there alternating between his trademark slap bass and a quiet section for the vocals.
The song's narrative describes several different trades that the town's blue collar tweekers engage in, but, like many of the other story-telling songs in Primus's catalogue, lacks any clear, single meaning and leaves plenty of ambiguity in its lyrics. The song is about truck drivers and ""blue-collar workers"" using methamphetamine.

I was born in a suburb by the East Bay, a rural, almost redneck environment. I grew up on the blue-collar side of town. My father was a mechanic, both my uncles are mechanics, my grandfather was a mechanic. That song is not derogatory at all. It’s very much me. A tweaker is someone who is strung out on methyl amphetamines, otherwise known as crank. There’s a reference in there to a guy who hung Sheetrock, and that’s how he got through the day. He’d snort up speed to keep up with the younger guys."

Emerging from the West Coast hip hop scene in the mid-2000s, Hussle independently released his debut mixtape, Slauson Boy Volume 1, to moderate local success, which led to him being signed to Cinematic Music Group and Epic Records.
Hussle became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series, The Marathon, The Marathon Continues, and Crenshaw, the last of which American rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies for $100 each. After much delay, his debut studio album Victory Lap was released in 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for the Best Rap Album at the 61st Grammy Awards in 2019. At the 62nd Grammy Awards in 2020, two posthumous Grammy Awards for the songs ""Racks in the Middle"" and ""Higher"" were awarded to Hussle in the Best Rap Performance and Best Rap/Sung Performance categories respectively.Outside of music, Hussle inaugurated the Marathon Clothing store, which he founded along with partners Carless, the head of the agency, Karen Civil, and his brother Samiel Asghedom in 2017, and started a co-working environment which he named ""Vector 90"". On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store in South Central Los Angeles. Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who confronted Hussle earlier that day, was arrested and charged with murder two days later. Holder was found guilty of first-degree murder on July 6, 2022. On February 22, 2023, Holder was sentenced to 60 years to life in prison.

572,cat people (putting out fire),david bowie,1983,pop/rock,"""Cat People (Putting Out Fire)"" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter David Bowie as the title track of the 1982 erotic horror film Cat People. Bowie became involved with the track after director Paul Schrader reached out to him about collaborating. The song was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland in July 1981. Bowie wrote the lyrics, which reflected the film, while Italian producer Giorgio Moroder composed the music, which is built around only two chord changes.
The song was released as a single by Moroder's label MCA Records in March 1982, appearing in different edits between the 7"" and 12"" releases, alongside edits for other countries. It also appeared on the accompanying soundtrack album. The single was a commercial success, charting in the UK and the US, and topping the charts in New Zealand, Sweden, Norway and Finland. It is considered one of Bowie's finest recordings of the 1980s. The song has since appeared on numerous compilation albums and was remastered in 2017 for inclusion on the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set. 
Unhappy with the original recording, Bowie remade the track for his 15th studio album Let's Dance (1983), recording it at the Power Station in New York City in December 1982. Featuring production by Chic member Nile Rodgers and lead guitar by blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, the remake is more aggressive. Despite the remake being the more well-known version due to its parent album's success, some critics have expressed a preference for the original recording. The remake was remastered in 2018 as part of the Loving the Alien (1983–1988) box set."

579,lucky star,madonna,1983,pop/rock,"""Lucky Star"" is a song by American singer Madonna from her self-titled debut studio album (1983). Produced by Reggie Lucas, it was written by Madonna with the intention that her friend Mark Kamins would play it in his sets at Danceteria, where he was the resident DJ. In 1982, Madonna was signed on by Sire Records for the release of two 12"" singles; after the success of first single ""Everybody"", the label approved the recording of an album, and the singer decided to work with Lucas. However, problems between Madonna and the producer arose and he ended up leaving the project; she then called John ""Jellybean"" Benitez, her boyfriend at the time, to work on the remaining songs. 
A dance song with disco influences, the lyrics to ""Lucky Star"" are a double-entendre that compare a lover's body with the stars in the sky. It was first released as a double-sided single with ""Holiday"" on August 1983. One month later, it was published as a stand-alone single in Europe and the United Kingdom; in the United States, a release was issued on August 8, 1984. Critics reacted positively towards ""Lucky Star"", highlighting its optimistic sound; in retrospective reviews, it is now considered one of Madonna's best singles. It reached the fourth spot of the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna her first top-five hit. It also peaked within the top-ten in Canada, and the top 20 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. 
The song's music video shows the singer dancing against a white backdrop with her brother Christopher and her friend Erika Belle. Some authors noted that in the video Madonna portrayed herself in a narcissistic way, that she was referring to herself as the titular lucky star. Additionally, after the visual's release, the singer's fashion became a trend among the younger generation. Madonna has performed ""Lucky Star"" in four of her concert tours, the last being 2015–2016's Rebel Heart Tour. The single has been referenced in movies like Pulp Fiction (1994), and covered and sampled by artists such as Chris Colfer and Carly Rae Jepsen."

Jimi Hendrix plays the main riff of the song on the album Band of Gypsys while he is moving to LP's last song, ""We Gotta Live Together"". The song's ""Yah-yah-yah"" refrain was referenced in The Illusion's 1969 hit ""Did You See Her Eyes"".

The first edition of 900 copies was released on November 10, 1981, on the band's original label Leathür Records. Elektra Records signed the band the following year, at which point the album was remixed and partially re-recorded. This re-release, with a different track listing and slightly different artwork (e.g., red lettering on the cover and a different interior photograph of the band), has become the standard version from which all later reissues derive. The re-recorded album also removed the song ""Stick to Your Guns"", though it is featured on a bonus track version of the album. The original mix of the album remained unreleased on CD until 2002, when it was included in the Music to Crash Your Car To: Vol. 1 box set compilation.
While the album only reached number 77 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, it would ultimately reach platinum status.
The songs ""Stick to Your Guns"" and ""Live Wire"" were released as singles for the album. The cover is an homage to The Rolling Stones' 1971 album Sticky Fingers.

657,"good morning, captain",slint,1991,pop/rock,"Spiderland is the second and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was released by Touch and Go Records on March 27, 1991. Slint's lineup at the time of recording comprised Brian McMahan on vocals and guitar, David Pajo on guitar, Todd Brashear on bass guitar and Britt Walford on drums. Spiderland was engineered by Brian Paulson and recorded over four days in August 1990. The music and vocal melodies were composed throughout the summer of 1990, while lyrics were written in-studio.
Forming in 1986 in Louisville, Kentucky, Slint had met as teenagers playing in the Midwestern punk scene but soon diverged sonically from their hardcore roots. By the time they recorded Spiderland in late 1990, the band had developed a complex, idiosyncratic sound characterized by atypical rhythmic meters, harmonic dissonance and irregular song structures. McMahan's vocal delivery on the record alternates between spoken word, singing and shouting. The lyrics are presented in a narrative style and cover themes such as unease, social anxiety, loneliness, and despair.
Slint broke up shortly before the album's release due to McMahan's depression. In the US, Spiderland initially attracted little critical attention and sold poorly. However, a warm reception from UK music papers and gradually increasing sales in subsequent years helped it develop a significant cult following. Spiderland is widely regarded as foundational to the 1990s post-rock and math rock movements, and is cited by critics as a milestone of indie and experimental rock, inspiring a myriad of subsequent artists. Slint reunited in 2005 to perform the album in its entirety across three international tours.

It was released as the B-side to his hit single ""Respect"", the second track from Otis Blue. The song is a sign of Redding's emerging mature and reflective side that was to culminate in his posthumous single ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"". ""Ole Man Trouble"" was also released on Redding's posthumous album The Dock of the Bay.As the ""Dock of the Bay"" represents a search for a place to settle down and find peace or a home, an old man is used as a personification for the trouble that can find a person after they have already endured it for some part of their life.

Crafted as a blues song with a classic soul melody set to country overtones, ""Ole Man Trouble"" helped Redding capture the growing white blues/soul market. The song was covered by a group called Hills Barbata Ethridge on their album L.A. Getaway in 1971, and by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion."

663,millworker,james taylor,1979,pop/rock,"""Millworker"", or ""Millwork"", is a song written by James Taylor. It was originally written for the Stephen Schwartz Broadway musical Working. Taylor's own recording was released on his 1979 album Flag along with ""Brother Trucker"", which Taylor also wrote for Working. It has also been covered by other artists, including Bette Midler, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, Jennifer Warnes and Francis Cabrel.
According to Taylor, he was inspired to write the song quickly one night at his home in Martha's Vineyard, ""about six feet"" from where he wrote his earlier song ""Secret O' Life"". He was initially impressed with the song and how he was able to write it from the perspective of a woman. He originally started writing the song about a truck driver, rather than a millworker, and according to Taylor the lyrics are not about any particular character in the book by Studs Terkel, Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do which was the basis for the musical Working. However, according to Bruce Springsteen biographer Marc Dolan, the lyrics were based on the words of union organizer Grace Clements, who was interviewed for Terkel's book. In the completed song, the protagonist became a young woman in the 1800s, who had been married to a drunken man and was forced to work in the textile mill after he died and left her alone with three children to feed. As relief from her drudgery she daydreams of her father's smile and her grandfather's stories. She recognizes that she is trapped and that her life is wasted because she made some poor choices. As she sings, she is miserable and old before her time, with nothing to look forward to. Taylor biographer Mark Robowsky describes the song as ""a transfixing self-portrait through the tired eyes of a female laborer chained by life to 'her machine.'""The title of the song used in Working was ""Millwork"". Stephen Schwartz regarded it as his favorite song in the show. He also claimed that the song was entirely Taylor's idea and that he did not even think of the subject as a possible song. Author John Bush Jones regards the singer of ""Millwork"" as being ""perhaps more anguished"" than any of the other characters in Working. Robin Lamont sang the song on Broadway.Rolling Stone critic Stephen Holden regards ""Millworker"" as one of the key songs on Flag, describing as ""Flag's most eloquent song"". Taylor biographer Timothy White describes the Broadway version of the song as ""a sublime, if under-esteemed, slice of stage magic"", also praising the ""dignity"" of Lamont's performance. Jones describes the song as ""graphic and powerful"". Robowsky describes the song as ""an anthem of class inequality and union solidarity"". ""Millworker"" was included on Taylor's live album Live and his compilation album The Essential James Taylor. Taylor performed ""Millworker"" on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 1979 along with two other songs from Flag, ""Up on the Roof"" and ""Johnnie Comes Back"".Bette Midler covered ""Millworker"" on her 1979 album Thighs and Whispers. According to Midler biographer Mark Bego, Midler's version is ""a real treat"", giving the song a ""slow and pensive treatment"" that brings the character to life. Billboard described her version as ""sensitive"". AllMusic critic Joe Viglione finds her version to be entertaining, and that it plays to Midler's strengths. Emmylou Harris covered ""Millworker"" on her 1981 album Evangeline. AllMusic critic Stewart Mason did not regard it as being very good. However, Mark Coleman and Mark Kemp of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide regarded her ""heartfelt"" version to be the one good thing on the album.
Harris had wanted to include the song on her previous album, Roses in the Snow, but her producer Brian Ahern convinced her that it was too much of a pop song for that bluegrass album. Bruce Springsteen sang the song honoring Taylor on the 2006 album A Musicares Person of the Year Tribute. Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder has covered the song in concert at the Delta Plex in Grand Rapids, MI, on Oct. 03, 2004.Francis Cabrel covered the song in French as ""La fabrique"" for his 1984 live album Public."

750,soft serve,soul coughing,1996,pop/rock,"Irresistible Bliss is the second studio album by the American electronic music group Soul Coughing, released in 1996. The band initially planned for Tchad Blake, producer of their first album Ruby Vroom, to produce the album, but the death of a family member in a car accident caused Blake to take a hiatus. Over the objections of his bandmates and his record label, Slash Records/Warner Bros., frontman Mike Doughty (then billed as ""M. Doughty"") hired producer David Kahne (Fishbone, The Bangles, Sublime, Tony Bennett, Sugar Ray, The Strokes); he was intent on following up the wild sonics of Ruby Vroom with a tightly wound, trembly, New Wave–inspired record.
The tracking, at Manhattan's Power Station recording studio, was complete in eleven days, and Doughty was jubilant at the results. Doughty tapped Steve Fisk to produce the tune ""Unmarked Helicopters"" for The X-Files soundtrack Songs in the Key of X.
All of Irresistible Bliss's songs were produced by Kahne, except tracks 2 and 6 (by Fisk) and track 12 by the band themselves. The mixing process split the tracks between three mixers: Kahne, Chris Shaw, and Ruby producer Tchad Blake, who intervened when bass player Sebastian Steinberg briefly quit the band.
Irresistible Bliss yielded a hit single for Soul Coughing, ""Super Bon Bon."" ""Soft Serve"" and ""Soundtrack to Mary"" also received some selective radio airplay."

763,the river of dreams,billy joel,1993,pop/rock,"""The River of Dreams"" is a song by American musician Billy Joel. It is the title track and first single from his 1993 album, River of Dreams. The song was a hit, peaking at number three on the US and UK charts, making it Joel's best-charting single of the decade as well as his final top ten in either country to date. It also hit the top spot in Australia, New Zealand, and on the Canadian and US Adult Contemporary charts. The song was produced by Joe Nicolo and Danny Kortchmar.
At least four versions of the song have been recorded and released. Two versions (released years later) include a bridge section containing a piano interlude paralleling Joel's melody from his song ""Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel),"" which is from the same album. These versions can be found on the boxed sets My Lives and Complete Hits Collection: 1973–1999 – but even these versions differ from each other, both in length and in arrangement: one, for instance, has more percussion. A fourth mix appears as a bonus cut on the UK CD single of ""River of Dreams"" — the ""percapella mix"" done by Nicolo.
""The River of Dreams"" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1994, but lost out to ""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston. Joel performed the song at the ceremony, and abruptly stopped in the middle of his performance in order to verbally protest Frank Sinatra's lifetime achievement speech being cut off earlier in the night.In 1993, Gary Zimmerman, a songwriter from Long Island, New York, attempted to sue Joel for ten million dollars, claiming more than half of ""The River of Dreams"" was based on his 1986 song ""Nowhere Land."" Joel said he had no knowledge of Zimmerman or his music, and Zimmerman dropped the lawsuit in 1994."

It was also issued as the second single from the album, in January 1988. The lyrics serve as a nostalgic reflection by Harrison on the days of Beatlemania during the 1960s, when the Beatles were first referred to as ""the Fab Four"". Harrison co-wrote the song with Jeff Lynne, who also co-produced the track. The recording references the psychedelic sound that the Beatles had helped popularise in 1967, through its use of sitar, cello, and backwards-relayed effects. Harrison's former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr is among the other musicians on the track. The single was accompanied by an innovative music video, directed by the partnership of Kevin Godley and Lol Creme. One of Harrison's most popular songs, ""When We Was Fab"" has appeared on the compilations Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989 (1989) and Let It Roll (2009)."

It was written by Fred Rose and Hy Heath and was recorded at Williams' final recording session on September 23, 1952, in Nashville.  The song has been widely praised; Williams' biographer Colin Escott deems it ""perhaps the best song [Rose] ever presented to Hank...It was one of the very few songs that sounded somewhat similar to a Hank Williams song.""  Williams is backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Chet Atkins (lead guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Floyd ""Lightnin'"" Chance (bass).  In the wake of Williams' death on New Year's Day, 1953, the song shot to No. 1, his final chart-topping hit for MGM Records.  Like ""Your Cheatin' Heart,"" the song's theme of despair, so vividly articulated by Williams' typically impassioned singing, reinforced the image of Hank as a tortured, mythic figure."

The track is a country song with pop influences.

Critics appreciated the track's simple production and lyrics. Commercially, ""Million Reasons"" reached the top 10 of the charts in Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United States, and Venezuela as well as the top 20 in Canada, Italy, and Scotland. The track received a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.

In order to promote ""Million Reasons"", the singer performed it on her Dive Bar Tour (2016), multiple television appearances, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016, the Super Bowl LI halftime show, the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and the 60th Grammy Awards.

It appears in two variations there: one the well-known, seven-minute version; the other a reprise, titled ""Isn't It a Pity (Version Two)"". Harrison wrote the song in 1966, but it was rejected for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. In many countries around the world, the song was also issued on a double A-side single with ""My Sweet Lord"". In America, Billboard magazine listed it with ""My Sweet Lord"" when the single topped the Hot 100 chart, while in Canada, ""Isn't It a Pity"" reached number 1 as the preferred side.
An anthemic ballad and one of Harrison's most celebrated compositions, ""Isn't It a Pity"" has been described as the emotional and musical centrepiece of All Things Must Pass and ""a poignant reflection on The Beatles' coarse ending"". Co-produced by Phil Spector, the recording employs multiple keyboard players, rhythm guitarists and percussionists, as well as orchestral and choral arrangements by John Barham. The track also serves as a showcase for Harrison's slide guitar playing, a technique he introduced with All Things Must Pass. In its long fadeout, the song references the closing refrain of the Beatles' 1968 hit ""Hey Jude"". Other musicians on the recording include Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Gary Wright and the band Badfinger, while the reprise version features Eric Clapton on lead guitar.
The song appeared as the closing track on Harrison's career-spanning compilation Let It Roll (2009), and a live version, from his 1991 tour with Clapton, was included on Live in Japan (1992). Clapton and Preston performed the song together at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002. ""Isn't It a Pity"" has been covered by numerous artists, including Nina Simone, Dana, Matt Monro, Galaxie 500, Cowboy Junkies and Peter Frampton."

On August 11, 2011, Dean Ween quietly released a two-disc, MP3-only collection of songs, The Caesar Demos, named after the band's original working title for Quebec—to friends on his Facebook page. In his comment, he stated the songs were all recorded between 2001 and 2003 while drummer Claude Coleman, Jr. was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident, and that many of the tracks featured only himself and Gene. In addition to a handful of recordings that eventually made the album, the demos feature several alternate takes as well as a number of songs that have remained unreleased.Dean Ween recorded the guitar solo on ""Transdermal Celebration"" illicitly using Carlos Santana's guitar and amplifier at a storage space where it was to be shipped to New York. After being informed by a roadie, he took a hard disk recorder with him and successfully recorded it in ten minutes without getting caught.The album cover is an edited version of the packaging for the game Thorns from the 3M Paper Games series with the band superimposed on it."

937,bits and pieces,the dave clark five,1964,pop/rock,"""Bits and Pieces"" is a song by British beat group The Dave Clark Five. The single hit number 2 in the UK and number 4 in the US, as well as being a success in other countries. It was number 2 or 4 in Australia, number 1 in Canada and Ireland, and number 4 in the Netherlands. In Germany, it reached number 20.Lead vocals are sung by Mike Smith, who also co-wrote the song.  
The song is in antiphonal style, with Mike Smith singing a solo line and the whole group responding. The drums have a very prominent part in the accompaniment. Additionally, some of the song's unique percussion was supplied by an exercise board, which two of the band members (reportedly quite intoxicated) stamped on, not always perfectly in time to the music.
Robert Christgau, writing in 1969, called the song ""a wonderfully serviceable rock throwaway, raucous and meaningless, perfect for shouting into the night.""  Cash Box described it as ""a hard-hitting rocker that the boys pound out in a steady, heavy beat style.""The song's distinct stomp-like pattern has been sampled by numerous musicians.The Dave Clark Five performed ""Bits and Pieces"" in an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show."

Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, while produced by Walter Afanasieff, the song was released as the second single from the album on August 22, 1990, by Columbia Records. An adult contemporary-influenced ballad, the song follows its protagonist lamenting the loss of a lover and confesses that ""love takes time"" to heal and that her feelings for her ex-lover remain.
Carey quickly recorded ""Love Takes Time"" at the last minute when the album was already considered complete and being processed for release. She played the song's demo to former Columbia CEO Don Ienner while on an airplane. Ienner and other officials immediately insisted the song be included on her upcoming album, even though the album was already going through final stages of completion and Carey wanted to save it for her sophomore effort. Eventually the song made it on to the album as the closing track, however, due to its late addition, it was not listed as such on early pressings of the album. Subsequent pressings of the album corrected this error.
""Love Takes Time"" was well received by music critics and went to become another success from the album in North America. It became Carey's second number-one single in the United States, attaining the position for three weeks. However, the song did not replicate the success of its predecessor globally. A music video was provided for the song, filmed in black and white at a beach. ""Love Takes Time"" has been included on Carey's compilation album Greatest Hits (2001), as well as #1 to Infinity (2015), among others. ""Love Takes Time"" was heavily promoted in the US, being performed live on shows such as The Arsenio Hall Show, Mariah's Thanksgiving NBC Special and The Des O'Connor Show. Since its release, the song has been included on set lists of Carey's numerous concert tours and residencies."

Headquarters became the group's third consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified double platinum in the United States with sales of more than two million copies within the first two months of release. It also peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts. It is included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

The follow-up to her internationally successful studio album Music Box (1993), and the holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from her previous releases by leaning increasingly toward hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took more control over the musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey considered the album to be the beginning of her musical and vocal transition, a change that would become more evident in her sixth studio album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and then-husband Tommy Mottola. On Daydream, Carey collaborated with Jermaine Dupri, Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, and R&B group Boyz II Men. With Afanasieff's assistance and the addition of a few contemporary producers, she was able to make a subtle transition into the contemporary R&B market, after previously only pursuing pop, adult contemporary and traditional R&B music.

It was the group's second studio release to feature the ""classic"" lineup of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Ellefson and Nick Menza, with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album. The album features some of the band's best known songs such as ""Symphony of Destruction"", ""Sweating Bullets"", and ""Skin o' My Teeth"", which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact.
Countdown to Extinction received positive reaction from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record.

The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.

1015,pd world tour (feat. puff daddy),black rob,2017,hip hop/reggae,"The discography of American rapper Sean Combs (known professionally under the pseudonyms Puffy, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy) consists of five studio albums, two collaborative albums, one remix album and seventy-two singles – including thirty-three as a lead artist and thirty-nine as a featured artist. 
Combs began his career in the music industry working as an intern at the New York-based record label Uptown Records. He served as executive producer for Mary J. Blige's debut albums What's the 411? (1992) and My Life (1994) and was assigned artists and repertoire duties for R&B act Jodeci. In 1993, he was fired from Uptown Records and promptly launched his own label, Bad Boy Records shortly after. He also took a then-unknown Uptown signee, the Notorious B.I.G., along with him to the newly established label. In August 1994, the Notorious B.I.G. released the song ""Juicy""; produced by Combs and one of the labels first releases, it ultimately became one of the most successful and influential songs in hip hop music. Combs served as the primary producer for B.I.G.'s debut album and the labels first LP release: Ready to Die (1994), along with its follow up singles — ""Big Poppa"" and ""One More Chance.""
Following B.I.G.'s success during his lifetime, Combs become widely known as his manager and hype man, justifying Combs himself debuting a lead performer with his 1996 single ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down."" Prior, he made recording appearances on Super Cat's 1993 single ""Dolly My Baby"" and Lil' Kim's 1996 single ""No Time,"" and worked mainly as a record producer or backing vocalist. ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down""—which also introduced Combs' next protégé Mase—proved to be commercially successful, soon reaching the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 where it remained for six consecutive weeks. By this time, the Bad Boy label had signed other acts including Faith Evans, Total, the Lox, 112, Black Rob, Craig Mack, and Carl Thomas.
In March 1997, the Notorious B.I.G. was fatally shot by an unknown assailant, prompting Combs to make his second commercial single a tribute song titled ""I'll Be Missing You"", with guest appearances from Bad Boy members Faith Evans and R&B trio 112. The song became the first ever hip hop song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, peaked worldwide charts in 15 countries, won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, and remains one of the best selling singles of all time. The song and its parent album of which it preceded, No Way Out in July 1997, remain Combs' most commercially and critically successful releases.
1997 would also be the year Combs would be the artist with the most weeks spent at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 19 weeks, and 26 when including the Combs-produced songs ""Hypnotize"" by B.I.G. and ""Honey"" by Mariah Carey. Additionally, he became the first hip hop artist to replace himself at the number one position on the chart with ""Mo Money Mo Problems"" replacing ""I'll Be Missing You"" the following week. In 1998, Combs would release the singles ""Victory"" (featuring the Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes) and ""Come with Me"" (featuring Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page) for the Godzilla soundtrack, while also cultivating acts on the Bad Boy label and producing material for other artists.
Combs released his second and third studio albums Forever (1999) and The Saga Continues... (2001) to relative success, albeit less than his previous work, and generally mixed reviews. By this point and onward, Combs and Bad Boy Records would receive criticism for being seen as the leading exploiter of the dumbing down and over-commercialization of hip hop, and for using too many guest appearances and over-reliance on samples and interpolations of older hits. Critics would often praise the production value and catchiness, but become weary of Combs' public figure and character, citing the remarkably materialistic or ""ego-centric"" nature of his lyrical persona along with an overall lack of originality; commonly alluding to a style over substance argument."
1016,ask any girl,the supremes,1964,pop/rock,"""Baby Love"" is a song by American music group the Supremes from their second studio album, Where Did Our Love Go. It was written and produced by Motown's main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland and was released on September 17, 1964.
""Baby Love"" topped the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States from October 25, 1964, through November 21, 1964, and in the United Kingdom pop singles chart concurrently. Beginning with ""Baby Love"", the Supremes became the first Motown act to have more than one American number-one single, and by the end of the decade, would have more singles hitting the top slot than any other Motown act (or American pop music group) with 12, a record they continue to hold.
It was nominated for the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording, losing to Nancy Wilson's ""How Glad I Am"". It is considered one of the most popular songs of the late 20th century, ""Baby Love"" was ranked number 324 on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It dropped to number 499 on the 2021 update of the list. The BBC ranked ""Baby Love"" at number 23 on The Top 100 Digital Motown Chart, which ranks Motown releases by their all time UK downloads and streams."

The song was written by Björk and was produced by Nellee Hooper, who produced the majority of her debut album.

The song received mixed reviews from critics, who discussed Björk's musical shift.

The accompanying music video was directed by the British music video director Sophie Muller.

It was an international success, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, number two in West Germany and South Africa, and the top 20 in several other countries, including Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United States, it reached number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first of nine number ones on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it stayed for three weeks at the top.The original single, though successful, did not seem to fit with Music for the Masses's darker sound, so Daniel Miller remixed the track for subsequent inclusion on the album. Alan Wilder, in the Q&A section of his Recoil website, writes that the band felt the single version was ""too cluttered"" and was the reason Miller's remix was commissioned. Miller expounded on this in the Music for the Masses re-master documentary DVD, stating he felt the original single version was too complicated and would benefit from being simplified.
It was remixed by production team Bomb the Bass and released again as a single in the US, known informally as ""Strangelove '88"", this time reaching number 50 on the Hot 100.

Atlantic Records artist representative Joe Galkin showed interest in Jenkins and proposed to send him to a studio. On the way to a gig, Redding had the opportunity to perform the songs ""Hey Hey Baby"" and ""These Arms of Mine"" as Jenkins and house band Booker T. & the M.G.'s ended their sets earlier than scheduled.
The performance of the latter song was highly praised; Jim Stewart was so impressed that he offered Redding a contract to record for Stax Records of Memphis, Tennessee, which Redding signed soon afterward. ""These Arms of Mine"" became Redding's first-released Stax Records single, with ""Hey Hey Baby"" on its B-side. After a series of unnoticed numbers, the song ""These Arms of Mine"" became Redding's first successful single and sold around 800,000 copies. The song was also included in Redding's 1964 (Atlantic Records) Atco label debut album Pain in My Heart."

1121,tommy can you hear me?,the who,1969,pop/rock,"Tommy is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Who, first released on 19 May 1969. Primarily written by guitarist Pete Townshend, Tommy is a double album and an early rock opera that tells the story of Tommy Walker and his experiences through life.
Townshend came up with the concept of Tommy after being introduced to the work of Meher Baba, and he attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. Tommy was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of Tommy, which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at Woodstock, the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the University of Leeds, the Metropolitan Opera House, and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The live performances of Tommy drew critical praise and revitalised the band's career.
Subsequently, the rock opera was developed into other media, including a Seattle Opera production in 1971, an orchestral version by Lou Reizner in 1972, a film in 1975, and a Broadway musical in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by Jon Astley in 1996, a deluxe Super Audio CD in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material."

1138,douggie mayu's,dispatch,2000,country/folk,"Who Are We Living For? is a 2000 album by United States indie/roots folk band Dispatch. Their 4th studio album, it represented a major departure from past recordings. Unlike the first album, Silent Steeples, it is electric; unlike the second, Bang Bang, many of its songs express political messages. Specifically, Open Up, Time Served, Passerby, and Blood have clear political undertones. This could be seen as foreshadowing for the development of Dispatch member Chad Urmston's post-Dispatch music career (as frontman for State Radio).
In the album's booklet credits, the band members are referred to under their Dispatch aliases. Thus, Chad Urmston is ""Chetro"", Brad Corrigan is ""Braddigan"", and Pete Francis Heimbold is ""Repete."" The Title of the album, cover and case art of the album was created by William Quigley based on a 10 ft painting he made during the 1992  La Riots  on his birthday April 29 entitled ""Who are we Living for"". As he was working on the painting the title came to him because of the Fear, Violence and Fires occurring right outside the walls of his then Los Angeles studio.  Quigley also performed with the Band as a Dancer  Pete named ""Mr. Wiggles"" from 1999 to 2006 in over 100  performances, while also designing some of  the stages.  The band started to develop a stage personality and highly charged show incorporating video, light, and performance as part of their act.
In 2004, Universal Records re-released Who Are We Living For with four additional tracks.  They were added to end, making the album 21 tracks long.  ""Bulls on Parade"" is a cover of the 1996 Rage Against the Machine single."

It appears as the sixth track on the band's final album Strangeways, Here We Come (1987). It features a backdrop of crowd noises from the miners' strike of 1984–85, the song is a favourite of both Morrissey and Marr.
The song was released as the third and final UK single from Strangeways in December 1987. Billed as ""the Last Single"", as the band had already broken up, it reached number 30 in the UK Singles Chart.
Despite its commercial underachievement, ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" has seen critical acclaim for Marr's guitar work and Morrissey's sombre lyricism. It has since appeared on multiple compilation albums and has been ranked by music writers as one of the band's best songs.

Slip-n-Slide and Atlantic released it as the album's lead single on July 16, 2002. A hip hop song, it was written by Missy Elliott who co-produced it with Nisan Stewart. Trina raps throughout the song while Tweet, one of Elliott's protégés, performs the hook. Prior to recording the single, Trina was already close friends with Elliott and Tweet. The track was mixed in Miami, Florida. Dave Meyers directed the song's music video in Los Angeles, which portrays Trina and Tweet going on a shopping spree.   
The song is about only having sex with men who have money. While this sexually explicit content was the focus of critical discussion, some music journalists identified ""No Panties"" with female empowerment, and Tweet said its message was refusing one-night stands and only having sex in a relationship. According to Trina, the title and concept was inspired by a saying often repeated by millennials.     
""No Panties"" received positive reviews from critics who listed it as a highlight from Diamond Princess. Tweet was singled out for praise, while the explicit lyrics attracted some criticism. Retrospective articles discussed how Trina became associated with a highly-sexualized image through songs like ""No Panties"". In the US, the single peaked at number 88 on the Billboard chart for Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In the UK, it reached number 45 in the UK Singles Chart."

The Extended Club Mix/Vocal track (6:34) from DM 86744 was excerpted for a dance medley, ""Medley: Out of the Blue/Shake Your Love/Only in My Dreams"" (Debbie Gibson Mega Mix), that became Track 4 on Atlantic DM 86556 ""Foolish Beat.""
A different mix, ""Only in My Dreams"" (LP Version/3:54), mastered from the original multi-track for DM 86744, became track 3 on Gibson's debut album Out of the Blue (Atlantic LP 81780), and a further variation, ""Only in My Dreams (Dream House Mix/10:03)"", was Track 3 on Atlantic DM 86556 ""Foolish Beat"".
Since the song's release, Gibson has re-recorded the song twice: in 1997 for her album Deborah and in 2010 for the Deluxe Edition release of the Japan-exclusive Ms. Vocalist.

It was released on December 14, 1999, by Jive Records as the fifth and final single from the album. After Spears recorded an unused song from Toni Braxton and sent it through Larry Rudolph to several labels, executives from Jive Records commented that it was very rare to hear someone so young who could deliver emotional content and commercial appeal, appointing the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. The teen pop ballad was written and produced by White, and features Spears singing about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard.
""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who noted the song as a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it unremarkable like other ballads on the album and calling it ""another rejection ballad that refers to kissing but nothing else"". ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" achieved moderate success, peaking at number 37 in Australia, and 23 in New Zealand. In the United States, ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and 17 on Pop Songs, being later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for shipping 1,000,000 physical units of the single. It was the 8th best-selling physical single of the 2000s in the country.
An accompanying music video, directed by Gregory Dark from November 22–23, 1999, was released on December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself to move away from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is going to miss her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" in a few live appearances, including at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, in a medley with ""...Baby One More Time"", and in three of her concert tours."

1340,these are the days of our lives,queen,1991,pop/rock,"""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Although credited to the whole band, it was largely written by their drummer Roger Taylor, and is the eighth track on the band's 1991 album Innuendo.The song was released as a single in the United States on Freddie Mercury's 45th birthday, 5 September 1991, and as double A-side single in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 9 December, in the wake of Mercury's death, with the Queen track ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". The double A-side debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for five weeks, topped the Irish Singles Chart for six weeks, and reached number 16 in Germany. The song was awarded a Brit Award for British Single of the Year in 1992. In 1999, it was included on Queen's compilation album Greatest Hits III.Ron Hart of Rolling Stone writes, ""the conga-driven synth ballad ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" is Innuendo's most significant single, given that it was released on Mercury's 45th birthday, and that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive, as it was filmed in May of 1991 during the final stages of his battle with AIDS. A ballad in the vein of ""Love of My Life,"" it was a song that carried a significant amount of weight given the frailty of Mercury's appearance in the black-and-white video, later compounded when unreleased colour footage from the filming emerged in Days of Our Lives."""

1421,he doesn't know i'm alive,janet jackson,1986,pop/rock,"Control is the third studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco, and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The distinctive triplet swing beat utilized on the record is also considered to be a precursor to the new jack swing genre. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.
Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly Black women.
Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—""What Have You Done for Me Lately"", ""Nasty"", ""Control"", ""When I Think of You"", and ""Let's Wait Awhile""—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, making Jackson the first female artist to have five top five hits from one album on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; ""When I Think of You"" became the singer's first number one hit. Control also set a record for the longest continuous run of charting singles on the Hot 100, at 65 consecutive weeks. Music videos created to promote the album's singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album remained on the Billboard 200 chart for over two years. It has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.Control went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, in addition to being included in several publications ""best of"" album lists. In 2016, it was selected for exhibition in the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC)."

1429,no more cane on the brazo,odetta,1954,blues/jazz,"""Ain't No More Cane on This Brazos"" is a traditional prison work song of the Southern United States. The title refers to work assigned to prisoners sentenced to hard labor in Texas. The labor involved cutting sugar cane along the banks of the Brazos River, where many of the state's prison farms were located in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
It has been recorded by Alan Lomax on his 1958 recording Texas Folk Songs Sung by Alan Lomax as ""Ain't No More Cane on This Brazis"", Odetta, Lonnie Donegan, the Limeliters on their album 14 14K Folksongs (1963), Son Volt on the album A Retrospective: 1995-2000, and The Band on the album Across the Great Divide. Bob Dylan also performed the song live in the early 1960s and his version is on multiple bootleg recordings taken from The Gaslight Cafe. An extensive set of lyrics to the song, as sung by inmates of Central State Farm near Houston, Texas, appears in folklorist John Lomax's book American Ballads and Folk Songs, originally published in 1934. Lomax collected another version of the song in a recording of a performance by Ernest Williams and James (Iron Head) Baker; the recording appears on the Document Records album Field Recordings, Vol. 6: Texas (1933-1958).
The song is sometimes attributed to Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly), but a recording of him singing the song is obscure or non-existent. A song titled ""Ain't No More Cane on this Brazos"" does not appear in the extensive discography of Leadbelly recordings contained in Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell's book The Life and Legend of Leadbelly. Alan Lomax suggests, in the notes for his recording, another source from the Texas prison community.  Possibly the song became associated with Leadbelly through his various recordings of another Texas prison song titled ""Go Down, Ol' Hannah"" which shares some verses with ""Ain't No More Cane on this Brazos"".
In 2006, Band of Heathens with their distinctive arrangement included it on their Live at Momo's album. In 2007 Lyle Lovett released two versions of the tune on his album It's Not Big, It's Large. On February 16, 2008, Lovett and John Hiatt performed the song live at the Ulster Performing Arts Center in Kingston, New York, along with The Band's Garth Hudson. On February 14, 2013, Lovett also performed this song with friend Robert Earl Keen at Rudder Auditorium on the campus of their Alma mater, Texas A&M University.""Ain't No More Cane"" is featured in the film Festival Express, where Rick Danko, Janis Joplin, John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and various other musicians drunkenly sing it while on the train going to the next concert on the tour.
The song, as ""Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos"", was also covered by the singer Ian Gillan of Deep Purple fame for his 1990 solo-album Naked Thunder. The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded the song on their 1963 album Singin' our Mind. Other covers include The Black Crowes. Chris Smither also covered ""No More Cane on the Brazos"" on his 1998 CD ""Happier Blue"". Bill Staines recorded the song on his 1975 album Miles.
It was also covered by Lonnie Donnegan in 1958 and by Canadian band Crowbar on Larger than Life (And Live'r than You've Ever Been) (1971, Daffodil 2-SBA-16007) (recorded in concert at Massey Hall, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). A version of this song is also recorded by The Wood Brothers on their live album Live Vol.2 Nail & Tooth. The song's lyric ""Captain don't you do me like you done poor old Shine"" was the inspiration for Poor Old Shine, the previous band name for the band Parsonsfield.
The song has also been covered by the band, The Magpie Salute, consisting of former Black Crowes members Rich Robinson, Marc Ford, and Sven Pipien. It can be found on their mostly live debut album, ""The Magpie Salute""."

Before the duo's foundation, Rich was bass guitarist in the country band Lonestar, while Kenny was a solo artist for Hollywood Records.
Their first studio album, Horse of a Different Color, was released in 2004. This album produced four straight Top 40 country hits, including the number 11 ""Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)"", plus collaborations with Cowboy Troy, Gretchen Wilson, and Martina McBride.

However, in 1984, WBAB Fingers Metal Shop, a radio station, held a contest to meet and hang out with Slayer during a live recording. The album was recorded at Tiki Recording Studios in Glen Cove, NY in front of around a dozen people. The album was originally intended to be recorded in front of a live audience, but things went wrong. Nevertheless, when asked if they were fake, producer Bill Metoyer said, ""I don't know if I should tell you."" The album begins with an extended introduction of ""Black Magic"", followed by a small speech. The remaining tracks include both those of 1983's Show No Mercy and 1984's Haunting the Chapel."

1477,the night before,the beatles,1965,pop/rock,"""The Night Before"" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 film Help! and soundtrack album of the same name. It was written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. Described as a pop rock or rock and roll song, its lyrics reflect on the singer's last night with his lover before being abandoned.
Recorded in February 1965, ""The Night Before"" was the first Beatles song to feature electric piano, played by John Lennon. Its film sequence was shot the following May, showing the band miming to the track on Salisbury Plain. The Beatles only played the song live once, during their final BBC Radio performance. In contemporary interviews, McCartney said that it was one of his favorite songs from the Help! film and one of the Beatles' best recordings up to that point. Critics have given it mixed reviews, with some praising it while others dismiss it as insignificant. Many fans consider it one of the Beatles' best early songs. George Martin, Herbie Mann, Josie Cotton, and Restless Heart are among the artists who have covered it."

1499,boulevard of broken dreams,green day,2017,pop/rock,"""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" is a song by American rock band Green Day. The power ballad is the fourth track from their seventh studio album American Idiot (2004). Reprise Records released ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" as the second single from American Idiot on November 29, 2004. The song's lyrics were written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong, and the music was composed by the band. Production was handled by Rob Cavallo and Green Day.
The song speaks from the point of view of American Idiot's main character, ""Jesus of Suburbia"", and is a moderate midtempo song characterized by somber and bleak lyrics. This is in contrast to the previous track on the album, ""Holiday"", which illustrates Jesus of Suburbia's high of being in The City. MTV's Green Day Makes a Video described ""Holiday"" as a party, and ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" as the subsequent hangover.
The song was ranked number one on Rolling Stone's Reader's Choice: Singles of the Decade list in 2009 and number 65 on the 100 Best Songs of the Decade list in the same year. It has sold over 2 million copies in the United States as of 2010. The single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Green Day's most successful song in the United States. The song was the ninth-highest-selling single of the 2000–2009 decade with worldwide sales exceeding 5 million copies. As of 2021, ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" is the only song to win both the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. It remains one of Green Day's signature songs."
