Explanation: ""The Flowers of War"" is a Chinese historical drama film directed by Zhang Yimou, a renowned Chinese filmmaker. The movie was produced in China and was an international co-production between companies from China, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. The film is set during the Nanjing Massacre in 1937, when the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the Chinese city of Nanjing. It depicts the story of a group of students and prostitutes seeking refuge in a Catholic church, where an American priest tries to protect them from the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers.
