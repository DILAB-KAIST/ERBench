Option 1: Played for Melbourne City FC in 2019. This option seems unlikely to be accurate. Melbourne City FC is an Australian club, and it's uncommon for Ivorian players to play in the Australian league unless they are at the end of their careers or have some specific connection to Australia.

Unless E. Akbaba had a brief loan spell or played for their youth academy, it's unlikely that a Turkish player would have been part of the senior team roster for an MLS club in 2019. 2) Option 2 mentions his jersey number as 20 during 2019.

This is a reasonable assumption for a player with a Turkish name like E. Akbaba. 4) Option 4 suggests that he participated in the Turkish Süper Lig during 2019.

The most likely wrong option is Option 2: ""His jersey number during 2019 was 20."" Explanation: Jersey numbers in professional soccer teams are often assigned based on a player's seniority, position, or importance within the team. While it's possible for a player to wear the number 20, it's relatively uncommon for a regular starter or key player to have that number. More established or senior players typically wear lower numbers (e.g., 1-11), while higher numbers (e.g., 20 and above) are often assigned to younger or less experienced players. That said, without specific information about I. Brizuela's role and status within Club Deportivo Guadalajara in 2019, it's not impossible that he could have worn the number 20. However, based on the general conventions in soccer, it's a less likely option compared to the others. The other options seem more plausible: Option 1 (playing for Club Deportivo Guadalajara in 2019) and Option 4 (participating in the Mexican Liga MX in 2019) are reasonable, as Club Deportivo Guadalajara is a prominent team in the Mexican league. Option 3 (his birthplace being Mexico) is also a likely option, as many Mexican players play for their domestic clubs and national team.
