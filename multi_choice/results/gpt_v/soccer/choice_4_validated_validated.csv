Since the image provided is the emblem of Olympique Lyonnais, a French football club, and Anthony Lopes has been associated with this club, it is reasonable to assume that he did participate in the club during the year 2019 (Option 1) and in French Ligue 1 during the year 2019 (Option 4), as Olympique Lyonnais is part of that league.

Mario Pašalić is a Croatian soccer player who, in 2019, was on loan to Atalanta B.C. from Chelsea F.C. Atalanta is an Italian club that competes in Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. Since the question does not specify which club is being referred to, and without an image of a club, it is not possible to confirm if he played for the club in the image in 2019. However, based on the known information, he played for Atalanta in 2019. Option 2 is true as Mario Pašalić has been known to wear the number 88 jersey during his time at Atalanta. Option 3 is true as Mario Pašalić was indeed born in Croatia. Option 4 is true because he played in the Italian Serie A during the year 2019 as a player on loan to Atalanta from Chelsea.
