And the poster says "From the director of Home Alone", so it's probably directed by Chris Columbus. And the poster says "From the producers of The Lord of the Rings", so it's probably produced in the country USA. So option 1 and option 2 are probably correct. But the poster doesn't say anything about the genre of the movie. So we don't know if it's an animation movie or not. So option 3 is probably incorrect.
