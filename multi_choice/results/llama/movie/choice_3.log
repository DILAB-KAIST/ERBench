A: 

<Answer> 
The inaccurate option about the movie Avatar released in year 2009 is:

Option 3: Has the genre of animation movie.

Explanation: Avatar, directed by James Cameron and produced in the USA, is a science fiction film that uses a combination of live-action and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create its visual effects. While it does contain some animated elements, it is not an animation movie in the classical sense. The film's use of photorealistic CGI and motion capture technology to create the alien world of Pandora and its inhabitants, the Na'vi, sets it apart from traditional animated films. Therefore, option 3 is the inaccurate option.
