A:

Option 2: His uniform number was 9 in 2019 is the false option. There are a few reasons why this is the case. Firstly, the question mentions that the soccer player's name is Jaume, but it does not specify his last name. Therefore, it is impossible to know for sure what his uniform number was in 2019. Additionally, even if we did know his last name, there is no guarantee that his uniform number was 9 in that year. Soccer players often change their numbers from season to season, or even within a season. Therefore, while options 1, 3, and 4 may be true or false depending on the specific Jaume being referred to, option 2 cannot be definitively true or false without more information.
