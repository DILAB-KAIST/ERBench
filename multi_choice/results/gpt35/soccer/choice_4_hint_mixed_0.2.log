Q: What is the false option about soccer player named S. Umtiti? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: He played for FC Barcelona in 2019.
Option 2: His uniform number was 17 in 2019.
Option 3: He was born in France.
Option 4: He played in Spain Primera Division during the year 2019.

A: 

<Answer> 
Option 4: He played in Spain Primera Division during the year 2019 is the false option. 

Explanation: S. Umtiti played for FC Barcelona in 2019 (Option 1), his uniform number was 23 in 2019 (not 17, but this is not an option), and he was born in France (Option 3). However, Spain Primera Division is the name of the top professional football league in Spain, and S. Umtiti did play in this league in 2019, but he played for FC Barcelona, which is a team in this league. Therefore, Option 4 is false because it implies that S. Umtiti played for a league rather than a team.

Firstly, Alan Carvalho is a forward player and it is unlikely for a forward to wear the number 4 jersey as it is usually reserved for defenders or midfielders.
