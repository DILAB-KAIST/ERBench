Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 2NM9.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is 33.2472.

Option 2: Latitude of the airport is 39.7195.
Option 3: Longitude of the airport is -86.5072.
Option 4: Country code of the airport is US.

A: 

<Answer> 
The inaccurate option is option 3: Longitude of the airport is -86.5072. This is because the given latitude and longitude coordinates correspond to the city of Indianapolis, Indiana in the United States, and not to an airport called Ranchaero. Additionally, a search for the ICAO Shortcode CL56 does not yield any results for an airport with that code. Therefore, it is likely that Ranchaero is not a real airport and option 1 is also inaccurate.

Option 4: Country code of the airport is US is the inaccurate option. 

Explanation: The reason why this option is inaccurate is that the ICAO Shortcode of the airport, which is 39OK, indicates that the airport is located in Oklahoma, United States. However, the country code of the airport cannot be determined solely based on its ICAO Shortcode or location. It is possible for an airport to be located in one country but have a different country code due to various reasons such as ownership, administration, or political boundaries. Therefore, without additional information, it is not accurate to assume that the country code of Paradise Air Haven is US.

Q: What is the false option about the airport Pasport? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 5MA3.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is -13.3578.
Option 3: The longitude of the airport is -72.1431.
Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

A: 

<Answer> 
The false option about the airport Pasport is Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

The reason why Option 4 is false is that the ICAO code "5MA3" indicates that the airport is not located in the United States. The first character of an ICAO code represents the region in which the airport is located. For example, "K" is used for airports in the United States, "C" for Canada, and "E" for Europe. Since "5" is not a valid region code, it means that the airport is located outside of these regions. Therefore, it is not located in the United States. 

Option 1 is true because "5MA3" is the correct ICAO code for the airport. Option 2 and Option 3 are also true because they provide the correct latitude and longitude coordinates for the airport.

Option 4: The country code of the airport is US is the false option. 

Explanation: The country code for the United States is "US," but it is not the country code for an airport. Airports are identified by a unique code called the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code, which is typically a three-letter code (e.g. JFK for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York). The given options do not provide the IATA code for the airport, so it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the other options.

Q: What is the false option about the airport Dew Drop? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 05TS.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is 33.1293.
Option 3: The longitude of the airport is -117.3457.
Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

This is because the latitude and longitude coordinates provided are not in the correct format for Boende airport, which is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latitude should be in the format of positive numbers for locations north of the equator, and the longitude should be in the format of negative numbers for locations west of the prime meridian. Therefore, the correct longitude for Boende airport should be 20.8833¬∞ E, not -97.7425¬∞ W.

Option 1: ICAO Shortcode of the airport is YNUT.
Option 2: Latitude of the airport is -15.8167.
Option 3: Longitude of the airport is -98.2386.
Option 4: Country code of the airport is AU.

A: 

<Answer> 
The inaccurate option is Option 4: Country code of the airport is AU. 

This is because the ICAO Shortcode YNUT indicates that the airport is located in Australia, but there is no airport with the name Nutwood Downs in Australia. Additionally, the latitude and longitude provided do not correspond to any location in Australia. Therefore, it is likely that this airport is located in a different country, and the correct country code should be identified.

A: 

<Answer> 
Option 1: The ICAO shortcode for the airport is the same with 83OK.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because it is not possible for an airport to have both an ICAO shortcode and a five-digit alphanumeric identifier (such as 83OK) as they serve different purposes. The ICAO shortcode is a four-letter code used to identify airports internationally, while the alphanumeric identifier is used for domestic purposes in the United States. Therefore, it is not possible for Sweetbriar airport to have the same ICAO shortcode as 83OK.

Option 2: The latitude of the airport is 27.342.
Option 3: The longitude of the airport is -80.522.
Option 4: The country code of the airport is SA.

A: 

<Answer> 
The false option is Option 4: The country code of the airport is SA. 

Explanation: 
Airport codes typically consist of a combination of letters and/or numbers, and they are assigned by international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The ICAO code for Aero Acres airport is indeed FD88, which is mentioned in Option 1. 

Latitude and longitude are geographic coordinates that are used to identify a specific location on the Earth's surface. The latitude of Aero Acres airport is 27.342, and the longitude is -80.522, which are mentioned in Options 2 and 3, respectively. 

However, "SA" is not a valid country code for any country in the world. Country codes are typically two-letter codes that are assigned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). For example, the country code for the United States is "US", and the country code for Saudi Arabia is "SA". Since Aero Acres airport is located in the United States, its country code would be "US", not "SA". Therefore, Option 4 is the false option.

Q: What is the false option about the airport R S  Auto? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 6IA7.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is 32.3547.

Q: What's the inaccurate option about the airport Moyer? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: ICAO Shortcode of the airport is 3PA9.
Option 2: Latitude of the airport is 40.2968.
Option 3: Longitude of the airport is 128.883.
Option 4: Country code of the airport is US.

A:

Explanation: The ICAO Shortcode of the airport is 3PA9, which is a valid code for an airport in Pennsylvania, USA.

The longitude of the airport is 128.883, which is not consistent with a location in the US, but this could be a typo or error in the data. However, the country code of the airport cannot be US if the airport is located at a longitude of 128.883, as this is outside the boundaries of the US. Therefore, option 4 is the inaccurate option.
