Q: What's the inaccurate option about the airport Paradise Air Haven? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: ICAO Shortcode of the airport is 39OK.
Option 2: Latitude of the airport is 35.1115.
Option 3: Longitude of the airport is -65.715.
Option 4: Country code of the airport is US.

Option 4: Country code of the airport is US is the inaccurate option. 

Explanation: The reason why this option is inaccurate is that the ICAO Shortcode of the airport, which is 39OK, indicates that the airport is located in Oklahoma, United States. However, the country code of the airport cannot be determined solely based on its ICAO Shortcode or location. It is possible for an airport to be located in one country but have a different country code due to various reasons such as ownership, administration, or political boundaries. Therefore, without additional information, it is not accurate to assume that the country code of Paradise Air Haven is US.

Q: What is the false option about the airport Pasport? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 5MA3.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is -13.3578.
Option 3: The longitude of the airport is -72.1431.
Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

A: 

<Answer> 
The false option about the airport Pasport is Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

The reason why Option 4 is false is that the ICAO code "5MA3" indicates that the airport is not located in the United States. The first character of an ICAO code represents the region in which the airport is located. For example, "K" is used for airports in the United States, "C" for Canada, and "E" for Europe. Since "5" is not a valid region code, it means that the airport is located outside of these regions. Therefore, it is not located in the United States. 

Option 1 is true because "5MA3" is the correct ICAO code for the airport. Option 2 and Option 3 are also true because they provide the correct latitude and longitude coordinates for the airport.

Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is 83OK.

Q: What is the wrong option regarding the airport Sweetbriar? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The ICAO shortcode for the airport is the same with 83OK.
Option 2: The airport is located at 31.1669 latitude.
Option 3: The airport is located at -94.578 longitude.
Option 4: The airport has a country code of US.

A: 

<Answer> 
Option 1: The ICAO shortcode for the airport is the same with 83OK.

Explanation: This option is incorrect because it is not possible for an airport to have both an ICAO shortcode and a five-digit alphanumeric identifier (such as 83OK) as they serve different purposes. The ICAO shortcode is a four-letter code used to identify airports internationally, while the alphanumeric identifier is used for domestic purposes in the United States. Therefore, it is not possible for Sweetbriar airport to have the same ICAO shortcode as 83OK.

Q: What is the false option about the airport Aero Acres? Provide an explanation.
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is FD88.
Option 2: The latitude of the airport is 27.342.
Option 3: The longitude of the airport is -80.522.
Option 4: The country code of the airport is SA.

A: 

<Answer> 
The false option is Option 4: The country code of the airport is SA. 

Explanation: 
Airport codes typically consist of a combination of letters and/or numbers, and they are assigned by international organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The ICAO code for Aero Acres airport is indeed FD88, which is mentioned in Option 1. 

Latitude and longitude are geographic coordinates that are used to identify a specific location on the Earth's surface. The latitude of Aero Acres airport is 27.342, and the longitude is -80.522, which are mentioned in Options 2 and 3, respectively. 

However, "SA" is not a valid country code for any country in the world. Country codes are typically two-letter codes that are assigned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). For example, the country code for the United States is "US", and the country code for Saudi Arabia is "SA". Since Aero Acres airport is located in the United States, its country code would be "US", not "SA". Therefore, Option 4 is the false option.
