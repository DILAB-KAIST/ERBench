Option 4: The country code of the airport is US.

A: 

<Answer> 
Option 1: The abbreviated form (ICAO) for the airport is FA50 is the false option. 

Explanation: 
ICAO codes are four-letter codes used by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to identify airports and other aviation facilities. FA50 is not an ICAO code for any airport. Instead, it is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) location identifier for a heliport in Miami, Florida. The ICAO code for Wings-N-Wheels airport is KINF.

FA50 is the ICAO code for Opa-locka Executive Airport in Florida, USA, and it cannot be the same as the code for Wings-N-Wheels airport.
