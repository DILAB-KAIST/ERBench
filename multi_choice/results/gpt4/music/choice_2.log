Both options are incorrect. 

Explanation: 
Option 1 is incorrect because the song "Avon" by Queens of the Stone Age was not released in 1977. It was actually released in 1998 as part of their self-titled debut album. 

Option 2 is also incorrect because Queens of the Stone Age is not a blues/jazz band. They are an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, and their music is categorized as alternative rock, stoner rock, and hard rock. Therefore, their song "Avon" would not be categorized as a blues/jazz genre song.
