A:

 3. The publisher of the book is the publisher named Berkley.

The correct answer is B: The published year of the book is 2008. The reason for this is that the title of the book is The Lucky Guide to Mastering Any Style: How to Wear Iconic Looks and Make Them Your Own, and the authors are France, Kim, and Linett, Andrea.

The book's title suggests that it is a guide to help readers master different styles and make them their own. The title also mentions "lucky" and "iconic looks," which suggests that the book is about finding and creating stylish outfits that make the wearer feel confident and lucky.

Option 1: The published month of the book is October. This option is incorrect because the title of the book does not mention a specific month of publication.

Option 3: The publisher of the book is the publisher named Berkley. This option is incorrect because the title of the book does not mention a specific publisher.

The wrong option is C: 3. The publisher of the book is the publisher named ABRADALE PRESS.

The correct answer is B: 2. The published year of the book is 1963.

The wrong option is C: 3. The publisher of the book is the publisher named Cartwheel.

The correct answer is B: 2. The published year of the book is 1979.

The reason for this is that the question asks for the wrong option regarding the book titled Scholastic Reader Level 1: Whales and Dolphins, written by an author named Schwartz, Carol (ILT), Roop, Peter, and Roop, Connie. The correct answer is B: 2. The published year of the book is 1979. This information can be found on the cover of the book or by searching for the book online. Option 1 is incorrect because the published month of the book is not specified on the cover or in the online search results. Option 3 is incorrect because the publisher of the book is not specified on the cover or in the online search results. Therefore, the only correct answer is B: 2.

A:

 3. The publisher of the book is the publisher named Houghton Mifflin.

The correct answer is B: The published year of the book is 2009. The reason for this is that the book's title and author name suggest that it is a professional guidebook for office workers, and the title mentions "today's office environment." Given that the book is likely to be relevant to current office workers, it is likely that it was published recently. The fact that the book's title mentions "American Heritage Dictionaries" and "Edit (EDT)" suggests that it is a specialized guidebook for office workers, and the fact that it is published by a well-known publisher like Houghton Mifflin further supports this conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as the book was likely published in the year 2009.
