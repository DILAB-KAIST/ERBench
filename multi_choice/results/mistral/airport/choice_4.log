A: 

<Answer> 
 3WI4 is the shortcode of the airport Flying 'O'.

Explanation: Option 1 is the correct answer. The shortcode of the airport Flying 'O' is 3WI4. The shortcode is a unique identifier assigned to the airport by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It is used to identify the airport in various aviation-related documents and communications. The shortcode is not the same as the airport's IATA or ICAO codes, which are used for other purposes. The latitude and longitude of the airport are important for navigation purposes, but they are not unique identifiers like the shortcode. The location of the airport is also important, but it is not a unique identifier like the shortcode.

A:

Option 2: Latitude of the airport is 10.9.
Option 3: Longitude of the airport is -87.2105.
Option 4: Location of the airport is US.

A: 

<Answer> 
 44IN is the shortcode of the airport Campbell Field.

Explanation: Option 1 is the correct answer. The shortcode of the airport Campbell Field is 44IN.
