The song "Community Property" is a prime example of this, with its fast-paced tempo, distorted guitars, and tongue-in-cheek lyrics about divorce and property division. Country/folk music, on the other hand, is a genre that is typically characterized by its acoustic instrumentation, simple melodies, and lyrics that often tell stories about rural life, love, and loss. Therefore, it is clear that "Community Property" does not belong to the country/folk genre.
